UMP (Upward Message Passing) allows parachains to send messages to their relay chain. DMP (Downward Message Passing) allows the relay chain to pass messages down to one of their parachains. XCMP, is perhaps the best known of them, and this allows the parachains to send messages between themselves. XCM can be used to express the meaning of the messages over each of these three communication channels.

Parachains connect to Polkadot or Kusama by leasing a parachain slot on the Relay Chain. Apart from the slots for common good parachains ( ) , which are reserved for functionality that benefits the ecosystem as a whole, projects wishing to obtain a parachain slot need to participate in one or more parachain slot auctions ( ). The design of Polkadot and Kusama allows supporters and potential users of the parachains to help parachain teams secure a slot by contributing their DOT or KSM (respectively) via the crowdloan mechanism.

However, the ability to create assets was restricted to the Kusama Council. This trial phase allowed the Parity and Web3 Foundation teams and Kusama Council to evaluate the performance of Statemine before lifting restrictions and allowing anyone to create assets.

Polkadot‚Äôs infrastructure enables the transactions from the blockchains to be processed in parallel, also allowing the parachains to communicate and exchange assets between each other via cross-chain messaging, and with external blockchains through bridges.

Polkadot research and design is nearing completion and development is scheduled for the early part of 2019. Simultaneously, Parity Technologies will be finalising the ‚Äúnominated proof-of-stake‚Äù scheme and building in parachain consensus into Substrate ( ) , allowing Substrate blockchains to plug in to the global blockchain network that is Polkadot.

While parachains, which are connected to and secured by the Polkadot or Kusama Relay Chain, are first-class citizens of the ecosystem, Substrate-based solo chains can also connect to and communicate with ecosystem parachains using bridges.
22.21	729	[polkadot network web community chain ecosystem india]	https://medium.com/@india.polkadot/polkadot-india-an-introduction-9981d37f4b07	The Polkadot network uses a sharded model where shards ‚Äî called ‚Äúparachains‚Äù, allows transactions to be processed in parallel instead of one-by-one. Each parachain in the network has unique state transition functions (STF). Based on Polkadot‚Äôs design, as long as a chain‚Äôs logic can compile to Wasm and adheres to the Relay Chain API, then it can connect to the Polkadot network as a parachain.

These projects are related to blockchain and require a high degree of correctness. The project is not trying to be be involved in any implementation of any of work-in-progress Wasm proposals. Instead the project tries to be as close as possible to the specification, therefore avoiding features that are not directly supported by the specification.

14.71	415	[validators transactions dots blocks parachain participants parachains]	https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/wiki/Polkadot-Roles-&-Actors	These participants will play a crucial role in adding new blocks to the Relay Chain and, by extension to all parachains, such that parties can complete cross-chain transactions via the Relay Chain. Validators perform two functions. First, verifying the information contained in an assigned set of parachain blocks is valid (such as the identities of the transacting parties and the subject matter of the contract). Their second role is to participate in the consensus mechanism to produce the Relay Chain blocks based on validity statements from other validators. Any instances of non-compliance with the consensus algorithms result in punishment by removal of some or all of the validator‚Äôs staked DOTs, thereby discouraging bad actors. Good performance, however, will be rewarded, with validators receiving transaction fees in the form of DOTs in exchange for their activities.
