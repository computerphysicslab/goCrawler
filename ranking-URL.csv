41.02	13128	[the patients fig cells covid cell cd8]	https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/07/15/science.abc8511	The COVID-19 pandemic has to date caused >7 million infections resulting in over 400,000 deaths. Following infection with SARS-CoV2, COVID-19 patients can experience mild or even asymptomatic disease, or can present with severe disease requiring hospitalization and mechanical ventilation. The case fatality rate can be as high as ~10% ( 1 ( #ref-1 ) ). Some severe COVID-19 patients display an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), reflecting severe respiratory damage. In acute respiratory viral infections, pathology can be mediated by the virus directly, by an overaggressive immune response, or both ( 2 ( #ref-2 ) – 4 ( #ref-4 ) ). However, in severe COVID-19 disease, the characteristics of, and role for the immune response, as well as how these responses relate to clinical disease features, remain poorly understood.
54.51	16966	[the fda test tests eua testing policy]	https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergency-situations-medical-devices/faqs-diagnostic-testing-sars-cov-2	Serology tests can play a critical role in the fight against COVID-19 by helping healthcare professionals identify individuals who have antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 virus and have developed an adaptive immune response. In the future, this may potentially be used to help determine, together with other clinical data, whether these individuals may be less susceptible to infection. At this time, it is unknown for how long antibodies persist following infection and if the presence of antibodies confers protective immunity. In addition, these test results can aid in determining who may be eligible to donate a part of their blood called convalescent plasma, which may serve as a possible treatment for those who are seriously ill from COVID-19.
76.80	3281	[the research frankfurt sars covid institute cov]	https://www.goethe-university-frankfurt.de/74958144?search=covid	SARS-CoV-2 is the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. It is currently not known why some individuals develop only mild or no symptoms when infected, whilst others experience severe, life-threatening forms of the disease. However, it is known that the risk of COVID-19 becoming severe increases with age and is higher in males than in females. Many severe COVID-19 cases are characterised by increased blood clotting and thrombosis formation.

47.98	8030	[the patients disease severe fig moderate covid]	https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2588-y	One hundred and thirteen patients with COVID-19 who were admitted to Yale New Haven Hospital (YNHH) between 18 March 2020 and 27 May 2020 were recruited to the Yale IMPACT (Implementing Medical and Public Health Action Against Coronavirus CT) study. We assessed viral RNA load (quantified by quantitative PCR with reverse transcription (RT–qPCR) using nasopharyngeal swabs); levels of plasma cytokines and chemokines; and leukocyte profiles (by flow cytometry using freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells; PBMCs). We performed 253 collections and follow-up measurements on the patient cohort with a range of one to seven longitudinal time-points that occurred 3–51 days after the onset of symptoms. In parallel, we enrolled 108 volunteer healthcare workers (HCWs), whose samples served as healthy controls (SARS-CoV-2-negative by RT–qPCR and serology).
49.92	11272	[the covid patients sars cov ace2 disease]	https://www.nature.com/articles/s41569-020-0413-9	Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by a strain of coronavirus known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a global pandemic that has affected the lives of billions of individuals. Extensive studies have revealed that SARS-CoV-2 shares many biological features with SARS-CoV, the zoonotic virus that caused the 2002 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, including the system of cell entry, which is triggered by binding of the viral spike protein to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. Clinical studies have also reported an association between COVID-19 and cardiovascular disease. Pre-existing cardiovascular disease seems to be linked with worse outcomes and increased risk of death in patients with COVID-19, whereas COVID-19 itself can also induce myocardial injury, arrhythmia, acute coronary syndrome and venous thromboembolism. Potential drug–disease interactions affecting patients with COVID-19 and comorbid cardiovascular diseases are also becoming a serious concern. In this Review, we summarize the current understanding of COVID-19 from basic mechanisms to clinical perspectives, focusing on the interaction between COVID-19 and the cardiovascular system. By combining our knowledge of the biological features of the virus with clinical findings, we can improve our understanding of the potential mechanisms underlying COVID-19, paving the way towards the development of preventative and therapeutic solutions.
