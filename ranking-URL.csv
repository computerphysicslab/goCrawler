[1] ( #cite_note-crypto_currency-1 ) [2] ( #cite_note-reuterspricing-2 ) [3] ( #cite_note-3 ) Despite their name, cryptocurrencies are not necessarily considered to be currencies in the traditional sense and while varying categorical treatments have been applied to them, including classification as commodities, securities, as well as currencies, cryptocurrencies are generally viewed as a distinct asset class in practice. [4] ( #cite_note-4 ) [5] ( #cite_note-5 ) [6] ( #cite_note-6 ) Some crypto schemes use validators to maintain the cryptocurrency. In a proof-of-stake model, owners put up their tokens as collateral. In return, they get authority over the token in proportion to the amount they stake. Generally, these token stakers get additional ownership in the token over time via network fees, newly minted tokens or other such reward mechanisms. [7] ( #cite_note-proof-stake-eth-7 )

As the price of these cryptocurrencies has increased, graphics cards have also seen big price increases thanks to retail stock shortages. A range of mid- or high-end graphics cards from AMD or Nvidia are in short supply, mostly due to cryptocurrency miners buying them in bulk to build machines to mine bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies.

The values of cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and bitcoin have skyrocketed in recent months — a single bitcoin is currently worth well over $11,000 ( ) , although that figure is in flux and has been trending downward since a peak above $19,000 last month. This has led people to put together “mining rigs” — after buying multiple consumer graphics cards for the necessary computing power — and then try to turn a profit on their investment by mining for cryptocurrency like Ethereum.

While cryptocurrencies are digital currencies that are managed through advanced encryption techniques, many governments have taken a cautious approach toward them, fearing their lack of central control and the effects they could have on financial security. Since the inception of Bitcoin, several countries have accepted the new digital currency while many others have banned or passed strict regulations on it. In addition, the immediate success of Bitcoin has also led to the establishment of other cryptocurrencies such as Litecoin, Peercoin, and Dogecoin to name a few. The rise of cryptocurrencies also brings into question the legitimacy and security of these new mediums of currency and many fear the rapid fluctuations that occur with the price of these cryptocurrencies.

However, it accomplishes this feat by storing all transactions in a public database called ""the blockchain"" and someone who genuinely wishes to check this state must download the whole thing and basically replay each transaction, check each one as they go. Meanwhile, most of these transactions have not affected the actual final state (they create outputs that are destroyed a transaction later). At the time of this writing, there were nearly 150 million transactions committed in the blockchain, which must be replayed to produce a set of only 4 million unspent outputs. It would be better if an auditor needed only to check data on the outputs themselves, but this is impossible because they are valid if and only if the output is at the end of a chain of previous outputs, each signs the next. In other words, the whole blockchain must be validated to confirm the final state. Add to this that these transactions are cryptographically atomic, it is clear what outputs go into every transaction and what emerges. The ""transaction graph"" resulting reveals a lot of information and is subjected to analysis by many companies whose business model is to monitor and control the lower classes. This makes it very non-private and even dangerous for people to use. Some solutions to this have been proposed. Greg Maxwell discovered to encrypt the amounts, so that the graph of the transaction is faceless but still allow validation that the sums are correct [1]. Dr Maxwell also produced CoinJoin, a system for Bitcoin users to combine interactively transactions, confusing the transaction graph. Nicolas van Saberhagen has developed a system to blind the transaction entries, goes much further to cloud the transaction graph (as well as not needed the user interaction) [3]. Later,  ..."

The values of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin have skyrocketed in recent months — a single bitcoin is currently worth well over $11,000 ( ) , although that figure is in flux and has been trending downward since a peak above $19,000 last month. This has led people to put together “mining rigs” — after buying multiple consumer graphics cards for the necessary computing power — and try to turn a profit on their investment by mining for cryptocurrency.

Blockchains use tremendous amounts of energy. According to Digiconomist’s Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index ( ) , cryptocurrency Bitcoin’s current estimated annual electricity consumption stands at 29.05TWh, which represents 0.13% of total global electricity consumption. That means Bitcoin mining is now using more electricity than 159 individual countries! This consumption isn’t just bad for the environment, it costs a lot of money.

The bad actors are not trusted any more than any other user of the network and their access does not grant them any special rights.

Every Bitcoin transaction is recorded on its blockchain, a publicly accessible record of all transactions made using the currency. Blockchains “provide a really useful source of truth,” says Jonathan Levin, cofounder of Chainalysis ( ) , which develops software tools for analyzing blockchain data. Its products can help investigators draw inferences about how people are using the currency.

The “crypto” in cryptocurrency comes from the use of cryptography, which is used to solve several core problems in transferring money over the internet, eliminating the unauthorized creation of new money (referred to as “double-spend”), and giving users a secure way to prove their identities and transact with each other without the need for a trusted intermediary.

Miners are also paid with voluntary fees set by the signatories of each transaction. When a miner finds a block, they collect the fees from each transaction included in their block. A miner is free to choose which, if any, transactions they include in a block as long as the transactions are valid and don’t make the block too big. Miners who wish to increase their income then have an incentive to include transactions with higher fees per kilobyte over ones that provide less.

The blockchain keeps track of a set of validators, and anyone who holds the blockchain’s base cryptocurrency (in Ethereum’s case, ether) can become a validator by sending a special type of transaction that *locks up their ether into a deposit*. The process of creating and agreeing to new blocks is then done through a consensus algorithm that all current validators can participate in.

One significant development is the rise of central bank digital currencies, which are the governmental take on cryptocurrencies—central banks issuing natively digital money. China and Russia have notably been working on these projects for some time, and the Chinese sovereign coin, or “digital yuan,” is expected to be launched this year. The implications for international sanctions are vast. First, these projects inevitably run on private blockchains that provide no traceability to outside countries the way a bitcoin network does. The second is that these instruments are completely outside the purview of current U.S.-led global financial architecture. Countries that are still open to cooperating with Iran could easily explore avenues through the use of such sovereign coins.

Blockchain is a technological innovation that lets people move digital items online, including money, in a secure and efficient way.

Cryptocollectibles like CryptoKitties are built on blockchain technology, and people can buy them using cryptocurrencies (usually Ethereum).

Cryptocurrency utilizes a technology called blockchain, which manages and records transactions in a network of computers on a decentralized network. The blockchain can be thought of as a never-ending receipt of all verified transactions. Cryptocurrency is appealing to many because of its decentralized network, which eschews a central authority, such as the government, or central banks that can manipulate prices and the level of privacy and anonymity in transactions when used correctly. Cryptomining is the process by which new coins are entered into circulation. Mining is a lottery to create new blocks in the Bitcoin blockchain which track and verify all transactions performed on the decentralized network. In exchange for handling these transactions, cryptocurrency is rewarded in a form of a lottery system that runs every 10 minutes.

It is too complex to summarize here, but the result is the same as if two parties switched private keys in person, except that there is no room for cheating. That is, coins are moved between parties but the blockchain does not see this and therefore chain analysis cannot link them — except to the extent that they look funny, so if there are almost no users doing this, their transactions can be linked on this fact alone. To the best of my knowledge, there are no tools which support this.

She comments:
24.55	7318	[blockchain bitcoin ethereum blockchains transactions cryptocurrency proof]	https://captainaltcoin.com/what-is-blockchain/	Dash, earlier called Darkcoin, implemented CoinJoin. It is a procedure developed for Bitcoin that combines the in- and outputs of several transactions in one transaction and thus mixes them. Dash established so-called MasterNodes to enable the optional use of CoinJoin. The MasterNodes earn money for their service, and it is the only known way to incentivize non-mining nodes of a cryptocurrency.
19.36	1706	[blockchains blockchain private proof fully consortium technology]	https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/08/07/on-public-and-private-blockchains/	"* *Public blockchains* : a public blockchain is a blockchain that anyone in the world can read, anyone in the world can send transactions to and expect to see them included if they are valid, and anyone in the world can participate in the consensus process - the process for determining what blocks get added to the chain and what the current state is. As a substitute for centralized or quasi-centralized trust, public blockchains are secured by cryptoeconomics - the combination of economic incentives and cryptographic verification using mechanisms such as proof of work or proof of stake, following a general principle that the degree to which someone can have an influence in the consensus process is proportional to the quantity of economic resources that they can bring to bear. These blockchains are generally considered to be ""fully decentralized""."

Many of them could tweak its model by, for example, finding alternatives to its energy-intensive “mining” process, which pays participants newly minted bitcoins in return for providing the computing power needed to maintain the ledger. A group of vetted participants within an industry might instead agree to join a private blockchain, say, that needs less security. Blockchains can also implement business rules, such as transactions that take place only if two or more parties endorse them, or if another transaction has been completed first. As with Napster and peer-to-peer technology, a clever idea is being modified and improved. In the process, it is fast throwing off its reputation for shadiness.

Bitcoin uses the concept of a blockchain, which is an encrypted digital ledger, recording all transactions that have occurred for a specific Bitcoin since its inception. The protocols underlying the blockchain use a distributed peer-to-peer computer network to perform the functions of an intermediary, ensuring that transactions between parties are valid and trusted. Essentially, the blockchain protocols, through cryptography, eliminate the need for a centralized authority, such as a bank, by distributing that function across a computer network of disparate participants, not controlled by any one entity.

Similarly, extremists who falsely believe cryptocurrencies to be a zero-sum game might want to sabotage Ethereum for a perceived increase in the value or stature of their coins. And of course, there are people who might want to attack the Ethereum miners for the amusement value. Because the attack currently has no cost, it is quite possible for these groups to launch it.

In many ways, 2017 marked the year that cryptocurrency stopped being about technologically innovative peer-to-peer cash and instead essentially became a new, unregulated penny stock market. 2017 was also the year that the very institutions Bitcoin originally sought to dismantle have begun to co-opt it for profit.

It is created by miners ( ) , and there is one coinbase transaction per block. Because each block comes with a reward of newly created Bitcoins (e.g. 50 BTC for the first 210,000 blocks), the first transaction of a block is, with few exceptions, the transaction that grants those coins to their recipient (the miner). In addition to the newly created Bitcoins, the coinbase transaction is also used for assigning the recipient of any transaction fees that were paid within the other transactions being included in the same block. The coinbase transaction can assign the entire reward to a single Bitcoin address, or split it in portions among multiple addresses, just like any other transaction. Coinbase transactions always contain outputs totalling the sum of the block reward plus all transaction fees collected from the other transactions in the same block.

From bitcoin’s inception, production of the currency was limited by Satoshi Nakamoto to a maximum of twenty-one million coins, insuring eventual scarcity. A few holders of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have earned (or “mined,” as the terminology goes) their coins by providing the computing power that enables and verifies transactions in the network. Other holders have purchased them. Currency exchanges such as Coinbase, headquartered in San Francisco, allow anyone to buy a coin or a fraction of a coin for either fiat or cryptocurrencies, thus opening up the market to new users. The opaque universe in which the coins move, in conjunction with widespread uncertainty regarding future regulation—and the future of the crypto market itself—have created speculation and almost unheard of amounts of volatility. Some cryptocurrency pump-and-dump and pyramid schemes have resulted in Bernie Madoff-like levels of fraud. Wide-scale legitimate uses for the currency have proved elusive, and many now see bitcoin as a store of value rather than something with which you can buy a cheesesteak or pay for a manicure. There is also an environmental cost, a byproduct of the amount of computing power it can take to mine cryptocurrencies.

Recall that block creation or “mining” in bitcoin and Ethereum uses a proof-of-work scheme, in which a mathematical problem must be solved in order to generate a block and claim its reward. The value of this reward inevitably turns mining into an arms race, with miners competing to solve the problems faster. To compensate, the network periodically adjusts the difficulty to maintain a constant rate of block creation, once every 10 minutes in bitcoin or 15 seconds in Ethereum.

For almost all rules, there's a way to prove this. In double spends, we show two transactions. In script validation you show inputs and outputs. Subsidy, where miners might introduce too many coins, you cannot prove in a short way that the amount introduced the fee was wrong, because you would need to show all the inputs to all the transactions in the block, to do this. So by simply adding the input amounts to the witness data, you could get a consensus rule that the witness needs to have correct input data, it could be pruned like all the other witness data, and it allows us to prove that.

Accordingly, the incident will be an important test of the cryptocurrency's decentralized governance structure. No single person or institution can order Bitcoin miners to abandon the 0.8 branch of the blockchain in favor of the 0.7 branch. Rather, the ""winning"" branch is effectively chosen by a majority vote of the network's computing power. Bitcoin's technical developers must convince a majority of the network's miners to voluntarily downgrade their software.

This is done by simply referencing all the utxos, then ringsigning with a combination of all their associated pubkeys. Double-spending is prevented using a so-called ""key image"", a novel feature of BRS. The key image is a component of a BRS signature which is determined entirely by the private key used to produce the signature. This means that two signatures which use the same private key, i.e. which try to spend the same coin twice, will have the same key image. Thus preventing double-spending is as easy as ensuring that the same key image never appears twice. (On the other hand, the key image cannot be inverted to obtain the original private key; thus in the absense of double-spending attempts it cannot be used to deanonymize the signature.) The value of the transaction input is the value of each of the referenced outputs, which must all be the same. (Alternately, as suggested by gmaxwell, the outputs might have various values, in which case the input value is their minimum. We will not consider this, except to point out that it doesn't interfere with anything else that will be said.) This uniform-output-value requirement on our ring signatures is a serious burden. It reduces the anonymity set available to the spender of any given output, and makes any minimum anonymity set size requirement unworkable. (We want a minimum anonymity set size to prevent people creating ""ring signatures"" with only one public key, incontrovertibly spending an output and retroactively removing it from every anonymity set that it had been used in.) To correct this, we propose an output-encoding scheme by which outputs of *every possible size* are created alongside each real output. We f ..."

There is a finite amount of Bitcoin, and the most recent projections show it will take about another 120 years ( ) to mine all 21 million Bitcoins. There is also, theoretically, a tipping point somewhere in there where the amount of energy it takes to mine a piece of Bitcoin is more valuable than the Bitcoin itself, though it all depends on the market value. But Bitcoin transactions, not just mining, require electricity (one transaction could currently power a home for a week ( ) ), so the more widely used it is, the more carbon we are pumping into the atmosphere.

Futures allow people to speculate on the future price of a commodity. This has plenty of legitimate uses ― farmers might want to lock in a future price for their harvests, airlines might want to guarantee fuel costs, etc. But there is no reason why people should need to lock in a future price on bitcoins. The sole function of a bitcoin futures market is to expand the scale of speculation ― the same way that mortgage-backed securities and credit default swaps enabled trillions of dollars worth of speculation on subprime mortgages.

If a client does not understand a rule without the prefix, it may use it unmodified for mining. On the other hand, when this prefix is used, it indicates a more subtle change to the block structure or generation transaction; examples of this would be BIP 34 ( ) (because it modifies coinbase construction) and 141 ( ) (since it modifies the txid hashing and adds a commitment to the generation transaction). A client that does not understand a rule prefixed by '!' must not attempt to process the template, and must not attempt to use it for mining even unmodified."

34.53	1643	[carbon energy footprint bitcoin mining emissions co2]	https://www.researchgate.net/publication/346717447_Bitcoin_Carbon_Footprint_Mining_Pools_Based_Estimate_Methodology	There are now hundreds of cryptocurrencies in existence and the technological backbone of many of these currencies is blockchain—a digital ledger of transactions. The competitive process of adding blocks to the chain is computation-intensive and requires large energy input. Here we demonstrate a methodology for calculating the minimum power requirements of several cryptocurrency networks and the energy consumed to produce one US dollar’s (US$) worth of digital assets. From 1 January 2016 to 30 June 2018, we estimate that mining Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Monero consumed an average of 17, 7, 7 and 14 MJ to generate one US$, respectively. Comparatively, conventional mining of aluminium, copper, gold, platinum and rare earth oxides consumed 122, 4, 5, 7 and 9 MJ to generate one US$, respectively, indicating that (with the exception of aluminium) cryptomining consumed more energy than mineral mining to produce an equivalent market value. While the market prices of the coins are quite volatile, the network hashrates for three of the four cryptocurrencies have trended consistently upward, suggesting that energy requirements will continue to increase. During this period, we estimate mining for all 4 cryptocurrencies was responsible for 3–15 million tonnes of CO2 emissions. © 2018, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

In bitcoin’s case, for instance, the currency is backed by “miners” due to the absence of a centralised authority confirming transactions. These miners effectively enter a competition to waste the most electricity possible by doing pointless arithmetic quintillions of times a second. One lucky competitor wins both a reward, worth about eighty thousand dollars in bitcoin, and the right to verify all transactions made in the last 10 minutes.

For those inclined to less-than-legal behavior, it helps that the blockchain encrypts transactions to provide anonymity. The payment network is maintained by bitcoin “miners,” a decentralized group of individuals with powerful computers that approve transactions and are rewarded with new bitcoins for their work. The total possible supply of bitcoin in the world is capped. Thus, bitcoin solves both of the cryptopunk money problems—the blockchain thwarts centralization, and the planned scarcity of bitcoins checks inflation.

11.80	1793	[bitcoin computation corporation private own key algorithm]	http://bitcoinmagazine.com/7050/bootstrapping-a-decentralized-autonomous-corporation-part-i/	As it turns out, secure multiparty computation can be used to generate Bitcoin addresses and sign transactions.

In these cases, CryptoCorp-style oracles will play an even larger role in the cryptocurrency world, and may even fuse together with private arbitration companies; whether it's a consumer-merchant dispute, an employment contract or protecting a user from the theft of his own keys, it's ultimately all a matter of using algorithmic and human judgement to decide whether or not to sign a bitcoin multisig transaction with a Bitcoin multisig wallet. As we sit here today on the other end of what may well come to be known as the ""great crisis of MtGox"", the merger of cryptography and finance is only just beginning."

Everything needed to create transactions can be managed from an online computer with a watching only wallet. All secret private key data ( ) is available only on the offline computer. This greatly reduces the attack surface for an attacker attempting to steal bitcoins.

The DAO could refund the user's gas, but still in that case the user would require sufficient ether funds for the computations they induce the DAO to make. We observe that a decentralized system of routers can route user messages to DAOs in return for a gas refund with additional incentives, and that a standardized routing protocol makes this system viable.

Then, ether will be mined just like Bitcoin. But acquiring another form of digital money is not the point. Ethereum is meant to work like an operating system for cryptocurrencies. Developers can create apps, such as social networks or file storage, that sit on Ethereum’s network as part of an app store.

Miners must compete with one another to be the first to find a new block. In return for performing this work, which requires massive processing power and incurs hefty electricity costs, miners are rewarded with a certain number of bitcoins for each block they add to the blockchain. Currently, that’s 12.5 bitcoins per block, and a new block is found roughly every 10 minutes.

The Bitcoin protocol subsidizes mining, but those subsidies have built-in checks on their growth. Today, miners receive small fees for the transactions that they verify while mining (accounting for around 10% of miner revenue), as well as whatever profit margins they can get when they sell the bitcoins they have mined.

One class of strategies that attempt to deal with this is making the deposit permanent, but these approaches have a problem of their own: unless the value of a coin constantly grows so as to continually admit new signers, the consensus set ends up ossifying into a sort of permanent nobility. Given that one of the main ideological grievances that has led to cryptocurrency’s popularity is precisely the fact that centralization tends to ossify into nobilities that retain permanent power, copying such a property will likely be unacceptable to most users, at least for blockchains that are meant to be permanent. A nobility model may well be precisely the correct approach for special-purpose ephemeral blockchains that are meant to die quickly (eg. one might imagine such a blockchain existing for a round of a blockchain-based game).

The bitcoin trust model, what we would hope, is one in terms of transaction ordering, we would have miners all over the world fighting for the next block, so we don't have clustering or single points of failures or single targets. In fact, we have a bunch of mining centralization than we maybe like if our goal is decentralization. Some things that approach this is that instead of a single entity like a bank or clearinghouse to decide which transactions to go through, you would have a federation of maybe a fixed group like 10 or 100 people to agree. That's obviously not decentralization, but it is obviously a cheap approximation which might be okay in some scenarios, but certainly not for what Bitcoin does.

The scope of applications of blockchain is much broader, though. For example, some firms currently use blockchains to track deliveries across complex supply chains. Consumers’ credit histories and vendors’ ratings could be recorded on a blockchain in the same way that centralised intermediaries such as Alibaba and Amazon do on their electronic platforms today. In financial markets, blockchains have been proposed as ledgers to track stock ownership, execute transfers of collateral, and settle payments in the interbank market. Even governments, whose authority blockchains were meant to reduce, have proposed blockchain-based solutions to maintain land registries.

31.35	1464	[bitcoin currency digital cash privacy peer money]	https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/01/bitcoin-step-toward-censorship-resistant	Perhaps the most interesting dimension of the Bitcoin project is its unorthodox approach to fraud prevention. Traditional currency systems have relied on trusted third parties to verify that the same unit of currency is not exchanged multiple times. For example, when you make a purchase with your credit card, the credit card company adjusts your available balance. Bitcoin addresses this problem without a third party by making all transactions public. As Bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen explained, every coin has a digital signature attached to it for every transaction that takes place; each time the coin is exchanged, another signature is added. If two coins appear identical, the one that was accepted by the Bitcoin network first is considered valid. Even though the transactions are public, the individuals tied to the transactions are anonymous. This is similar to how the stock exchange makes stock values public without disclosing individual owners. See the technical paper: Bitcoin: a Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System. ( )

19.86	1622	[transaction block transactions network chain attacker valid]	https://bitcoinj.github.io/security-model	Firstly, let’s recap how a regular full node works. The fundamental problem Bitcoin solves is achieving consensus on who owns what. Every node maintains a database of unspent outputs, and transactions that attempt to spend outputs that don’t exist or were already spent are ignored. Blocks are solved by miners and broadcast to ensure everyone agrees on the ordering of transactions, and so nodes that don’t see a broadcast transaction for some reason (eg, they were offline at the time) can catch up.

Each outcome is assigned a potentially unlimited number of shares which are valued at the event's end to be either zero or one depending on which outcome occurred. Shares are purchased or sold from a market maker which has a fixed formula C for its account value depending solely on the number of shares outstanding. The cost of purchasing or selling shares is the difference of this formula before and after the transaction. That is, the total cost to buy (or sell if the values are negative) M={M1,M2, ...,Mn} shares when there are currently N={N1,N2,...Nn} shares outstanding is C(N+M) - C(N). The following constraints ensure that the market maker formula C represents meaningful prices: 1. Probability. The price of a share is the market's indication of the probability of that outcome. Each term of grad C must be between zero and one and collectively sum to one. 2. Convexity. Repeatedly purchasing a set of shares is increasingly more expensive. That is, C(N+2M) - C(N+M) >= C(N+M) - C(N). The first two constraints suggest the consideration of the convex conjugate of C. The convex conjugate of a function f is f^(y) = sup_x { - f(x)}. The difference in the braces is the difference of the graphs of z=f(x) and the plane z= , with the supremum occurring when y = (grad f)(x). By sliding the plane down to be tangent of f, we have that f^ is just the negative z-intercept of the tangent to f. The conjugate f^ is immediately seen to be convex by expanding linear combinations of y and f(x) in the first equation. The conjugate of the conjugate is the highest convex function sitting below f since f^^(x) = sup { - f^(y)} = sup { + the z-intercept of the tangents to the graph of f}. = highest value at x on all tangents to the graph of f. = f(x) if f is convex.

Rather than require a single collective ledger of transactions, or awkwardly share the ledger among parties, Nakamoto suggested that a “blockchain” contain all transactions (including generated money by “miners” performing cryptographic proofs of work, described in more detail below). The blockchain is a Merkle hash tree of transactions. For each transaction the mining servers verify the hash digests that result from transactions, incentivised to perform computational work by being awarded money for successfully performing proofs of work. The transactions are verified by the miners and grouped into “blocks”; once the top node of each block is verified a specified amount of work is required to seal the block and win the resulting money.

It seems counterproductive to think of bitcoins as 'things', as if they were like metal coins. The only obvious 'things' in the Bitcoin world are the blockchain and peoples' public key IDs. A bitcoin payment, and the resulting shift in the balances associated with two bitcoin IDs, has 'happened' only once it is recorded on the blockchain by network members that are mining. In other words, it's not like the transaction first occurs and is then later recorded (a bit like me giving someone cash and then later recording it). It is in fact the very act of recording that changes the coin balances, or makes the transaction real.

Rather than processing mere transactions, Ethereum will use a Bitcoin-like blockchain to process complex contracts written in code. It could be the seed of a truly decentralized, more secure replacement for the current web ( ) , and could even create entirely new forms of virtual citizenship ( ) , defined by data on a blockchain rather than borders or governments.

So the further back Bitcoins are recorded against transactions in the blockchain, the more secure they become against tampering.

With governments around the world still confused on how to approach bitcoin, the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore has provided clear guidelines on how to tax bitcoins, which is a major step toward regulation.

To further incentivize miners (and to incentivize them after the block reward reaches zero) Bitcoin users can include a transaction fee when they send Bitcoin, to ensure their transaction is included in the next block. Transaction fees are never required, but you may end up waiting a while for your transation to confirm if you attach no transaction fee, if there’s lots of other transactions sending with a fee. There are only so many transactions that can fit into each block, so transaction fees also work as a method of reducing spam transactions.

[52] ( #_edn52 ) In fact, the arrest of DPR may have helped remove the association between bitcoin and crime, as bitcoin was revealed to be a less than perfect currency for criminals. The immutable ledger or blockchain, provides a record of every transaction.

Bitcoin’s free market mining incentives have already led to one multi-billion-dollar firm controlling roughly 40 percent of the entire network hashrate ( ) , and supplying most everybody else’s mining hardware to boot. Even with said hardware, the biggest operations with the most computers win more often, and other options available to the cryptocurrency underclass, like cloud mining, are rife with scams. ( )

The basis of this scam is that in order to use a cryptocurrency, there is a particular application to download called the “wallet.” The wallet is used for making calculations. It connects you to the blockchain and allows you to make payments. If a fraud wallet app is downloaded, it can misdirect any cryptocurrency coming in to the wallet and can empty out the account. There are also many fraudulent cryptocurrency exchanges.

Essentially, instead of all of the short-term volatility in demand for transaction space within a block translating into volatility in transaction fees, some of the volatility instead translates into volatility in block size. ## Why is EIP 1559 good? Copying from [an older ----------------------- There are three major problems with the status quo of transaction fee markets: * **Mismatch between volatility of transaction fee levels and social cost of transactions**: transaction fees on mature public blockchains, that have enough usage so that blocks are full, tend to be extremely volatile. On Ethereum, minimum fees are typically around 2 gwei (10^9 gwei = 1 ETH), but sometimes go up to 20-50 gwei and have even on one occasion gone up to over 200 gwei: This clearly creates many inefficiencies, because it's absurd to suggest that the cost incurred by the network from accepting one more transaction into a block actually is 100x more when gas prices are 200 gwei than when they are 2 gwei; in both cases, it's a difference between 8 million gas and 8.02 million gas. * **Inefficiencies of first price auctions**: see for a detailed writeup. In short, the current approach, where transaction senders publish a transaction with a fee, miners choose the highest-paying transactions, and everyone pays what they bid, is well-known in mechanism design literature to be highly inefficient, and so complex fee estimation algorithms are required, and even thes ..."

The first proof-of-stake based coin, PPCoin, was releasd by Sunny King in 2012, and has consistently remained among the top five alternative currencies by monetary base ( ) since then. And for good reason; proof of stake has a number of advantages over proof of work as a mining method. First of all, proof of stake is much more environmentally friendly; while proof of work requires miners to effectively burn computational power on useless calculations to secure the network, proof of stake effectively simulates the burning, so no real-world energy or resources are ever actually wasted. Second, there are centralization concerns. With proof of work, mining has been essentially dominated by specialized hardware (“application-specific integrated circuits” ASICs), and there is a large risk that a single large player such as Intel or a major bank will take over and de-facto monopolize the market. Memory-hard mining algorithms like Scrypt and now Dagger ( ) mitigate this to a large extent, but even still not perfectly. Once again, proof of stake, if it can be made to work, is essentially a perfect solution.

After surging from $99 to $1,147 late last year, bitcoin has fallen back to $344 this week, a decline of 70% from the peak. One big reason for the decline is thought to be the race itself to mine bitcoins: As miners sold their bitcoin rewards to finance new equipment, those coins added to the overall supply in the market.
23.36	1832	[bitcoin mining computers abiodun machines network hashing]	http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/12/21/into-the-bitcoin-mines/	When Mr. Abiodun first heard about Bitcoin mining in 2010, he thought it was a scam. Begun in 2009 as the imaginative creation of an anonymous programmer (or group of programmers) known as Satoshi Nakamoto, it was initially little more than a tech world curiosity. As early users connected their computers into the network, they became a part of the decentralized infrastructure that hosts Bitcoin’s open-source program. The computers joining the network immediately began capturing virtual coins. The network’s protocol was designed to release a new block of Bitcoins every 10 minutes until all 21 million were released, with the blocks getting smaller as time goes on. If the miners in the network take more than 10 minutes to guess the correct code, the Bitcoin program adapts to make the puzzle easier. If they solve the problems in less than 10 minutes, the code becomes harder.

Tether is a cryptocurrency that is pegged to the U.S. dollar held in reserve. Tether was coined to help facilitate national currency transactions on the blockchain, the distributed ledger technology that underpins crypto assets, but it has become a popular investment during downdrafts, market participants say. Here’s a look at Tether’s trading compared with bitcoin over the past three months. Worth noting is Tether’s relative stability and a slight inverse correlation with bitcoin when bitcoin falls. That means it tends to rise slightly when bitcoin slips, suggesting that investors are buying “USDT” and unloading other currencies.

As the market stabilizes in the coming months (or years), we will see undoubtedly see a revival of the Chinese crypto-market.

To make sure that the system is fully transparent and that transactions are completely free, FT-coin could be run by a Bitcoin-like algorithm designed and supervised by an independent non-governmental national authority. Just as in the case of Bitcoin, the total amount of FT-coins can be fixed in advance, at least in relation to a variable not in the government’s control (i.e. nominalGDP), while every single transaction (including the tax extinction using FT-coins) is monitored fully by the community of FT-coin users on the basis of the blockchain pioneered by the infamous Mr Nakamoto.

That network is built on smart contracts and a new class of cryptocurrencies that the team calls “Smart Tokens.” Bancor is looking to provide support to the illiquidity that currently exists within the cryptocurrency market. Illiquidity isn’t so much an issue for top coins like Bitcoin ( ) or Ethereum ( ) because there are always buyers and sellers looking to exchange those coins. It is definitely an issue, however, for the thousands of other tokens that may serve legitimate decentralized purposes but haven’t attracted enough attention in the market to be liquid.

It illustrates what Gavin Andresen (a Bitcoin core developer) pointed out ( ) two weeks ago in Amsterdam, that if Bitcoin became more popular (and thus the demand for tokens increases creating token value appreciation), the transaction fee itself (which was recently slashed ( ) ten-fold) would likely price out a significant portion of the intended consumer base: poor people. Obviously no one directly paid even $90 at its height in December, the cost was borne by every holder of bitcoin through token dilution.

With no central agency to verify that the currency is spent only once per possession, some were initially skeptical of its safety against market failure. Satoshi Nakamoto, the designer of the bitcoin protocol, had anticipated this problem, and built in a mechanism to verify each transaction that a bitcoin goes through.

Their reward is the possibility of more Bitcoin – the verification process is also the mining process. Most people are focused on the “mining” part of the process, but it’s the verification aspect that is profound.

33.04	7183	[bitcoin money value currency blockchain transactions price]	https://www.sindark.com/2013/12/11/open-thread-bitcoin-and-similar-currencies/	The ICO boom is an outgrowth of the emerging, occasionally inscrutable world of cryptocurrencies. These are a form of money (bitcoin and ether are examples) used in transactions which are recorded on a distributed public ledger called a blockchain. An ICO is a scheme to raise funds for an enterprise written into a contract on a blockchain. To buy in, punters use cryptocurrency to pay for tokens. Those tokens become the working currency within the new enterprise. A new social network, for instance, might fund itself through an ICO, then allow users to spend their tokens on goods or services on the network once it is up and running. In successful projects, demand for tokens should rise and early investors should profit. ICOs resemble both a new form of crowdfunding, and a technological leapfrog over the regulations that hem in more orthodox funding strategies. They are also all the rage. Ether, the currency used on the ethereum blockchain, is up by more than 2,400% against the dollar over the past year and boasts a market capitalisation of nearly $28bn. ICOs have so far raised nearly $2bn in 2017. ( )
19.58	938	[value gold market wealth store bitcoin risk]	http://guscost.com/2013/12/15/bitcoins-cash-and-gold/	In the case of Bitcoin, the most threatening eventuality is that the Internet goes dark and the blockchain ends. This might be even less likely, but many of the gold investors are also stockpiling guns and food so they are evidently thinking along those lines. If SHA-256 is broken the implications on digital security and the Bitcoin economy would be devastating as well. A less threatening situation might involve the lack of adoption by legitimate businesses banning by governments. This would push the Bitcoin market further into illegal territory, but where there is money there will be money laundering so it wouldn’t necessarily shut down the market.

I don’t blame you folks. Bitcoin is far from an easy thing to understand, It is new and strange and there are a lot of moving parts. “Peer to peer network”. “Protocol”. “Miners”. “Cryptography”. It’s a lot to handle, and in truth, most of its supporters don’t fully understand it either. As the media will tell you, they buy bitcoins because of frighteningly abnormal political affiliations like “anarchist” or “libertarian” which are generally euphemisms for “hates the government”.

Its an example of a decentralized example designed to reduce  inflation (although maybe not deflation) and the need to have a central authority. I agree with many that the bitcoin seems unlikely to be a replacement for fiat currency (government-decreed legal currency) and I also agree with the concern over the ultimate role of this currency that has a limit to how much can be “mined.” Still, important to remember that gold has very close to the same values and limits and has flourished as a protection against only using a national currency.

Mastercoin ( ) , for instance, is similarly a new protocol layer built atop Bitcoin but it is also a unique currency and platform. Like colored coins, Mastercoin seeks to extend Bitcoin functionality to non-BTC assets. Instead of coloring existing bitcoins, however, Mastercoin allows users to create and transfer their own asset-linked currencies at will that are then communicated and recorded in the blockchain message space. As a cryptocurrency, Mastercoin’s unconventional genesis, mining, reward, and incentive structure ( ) has raised a few eyebrows ( ). On the other hand, Mastercoin developers argue that Mastercoin ( ) ‘s enhanced features ( ) are an attractive draw. The problems may be fixable ( ). For now, Mastercoin, BitShares and the colored coins project enjoy an amicable relationship as they pursue similar solutions from different vantages–they recently formed a “self-regulating organization” ( ) to develop standards and a “solid legal foundation” for their mutual going concerns.

Bitcoin works on a protocol which cannot be changed unless all the users are in support to it. Bitcoin mining is another thing which keeps account of the transactions made, but the questions poping out is on its regulations, how do we control it? How to avoid illicit payments ( ) made using Bitcoin because it is completely anonymous. People use virtual wallet to make payments and the only way to track the person is wallet ID ( ) which cannot be retrieved to find the identity of person because anyone can create profile with fake name or whatever. Since, the transaction fees ( ) are quite less when compared to visa or conventional methods of banking, Bitcoin is expected to bring innovation in the transaction system. Rich companies who can adopt it would find easy to move along, and grab the opportunity and maybe taxation (Hide game). Smaller companies might not thrive because of additional computation energy needed for mining.

33.90	556	[currency bitcoin bitcoins users worth security servers]	http://rt.com/usa/internet-stolen-bitcoin-currency-226/	The administrators of Bitcoinica, a website that allows Bitcoin holders to trade in their e-currency for a value in US dollars, say that an attacker infiltrated their servers on May 11 and depleted the company’s online wallet of 18,547 virtual currency coins — worth roughly $87,000 USD. As a result, the website has suspended their transaction service while they open up an investigation to try to identify who broke into their servers and how the breach was accomplished.Upon noticing a series of unusual transactions, the website’s owners say they shut down their servers and locked down accounts as a precaution, but assured its users that their “trading and financial data is safe (as far as I know), apart from the Bitcoin loss.” In an address added to the main page of Bitcoinica.com later on, however, the administrators note that other information stored on their database was “most likely compromised,” but add that only currency owned by the site itself was stolen and that the money of most of its users was presumably safe because personal user information is encrypted separately from the actual currency.“We will have more to say soon about the circumstances surrounding this attack and what we will do to handle it,” continues the site.According to the website Blockchain.info, there are roughly 9 million Bitcoins currently in circulation. The crypto-currency Bitcoin was revealed in 2009 by an anonymous programmer and has been used in online transactions since, particularly in incidents where consumers and retailers are more likely to favor anonymity in their online purchases across international borders.

It goes down by half every so often. Currently, the reward is 12.5 bitcoin. The ""reward"" represents the creation of new bitcoin. Once all bitcoins are mined, the reward will be zero. In addition to the reward, miners also collect fees from all the transactions contained in the mined block. Eventually, the only incentive to mine bitcoin will be to collect the transaction fees."

Many who buy cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum don’t bother using the ledger to verify their purchase. Many don’t actually hold the currency outright, and instead trust an exchange to do the transactions and hold the coins. But people need to continually verify the blockchain’s history on the ledger for the system to be secure. If they stopped, then it would be trivial to forge coins. That’s how the system works.

For example, assurance contracts, in which people agree to fund a project conditional upon others contributing a specified sum, can be coded in Bitcoin. Alex Tabarrok’s variant, dominant assurance contracts ( ) , which pay back an extra penalty to contributors if the project doesn’t pass its threshold, can also be scripted ( ). Bitcoin scripts can also consult an oracle , a trusted computer program that publishes information into the blockchain, Bitcoin’s distributed ledger. This enables information about the external world to be embeddable into Bitcoin transactions. The decentralized prediction markets that Ed Felten’s team at Princeton is working on ( ) are based on this principle. In short, Bitcoin is not just a substitute for money; it can be a form of generalized, programmable, decentralized contracting ( ). Legalese gives way to Script.

Bitcoin is designed to enforce a strict limit on new production of its digital units. This rate of new production declines about every four years until eventually reaching zero. That is “zero” as in no more new bitcoins, ever again. As a result, the bitcoin ratio is set to surpass that of gold in 2022 and Ammous estimates it will be double that of gold in 2025 and then continue to pull ahead after that. This is not a matter of mere opinion, preference, or current market sentiment. It is baked into the nature of what Bitcoin is and how it works. There is also an intriguing recent indication ( ) that Bitcoin’s mainline long-term price trend has indeed been tracking its evolving ratio over the years so far.

When I buy goods online using Visa or American Express, if the goods never arrive, or if they aren’t what was advertised, I can complain to the credit card company. The company will do a cursory investigation, and if they find that I was indeed likely ripped off, they will refund me my money. Credit card transactions are reversible, Bitcoin transactions are not. For this service (among others), credit card companies charge merchants a few percentage points on the transaction.

Bitcoin accomplishes this by distributing the necessary ledger among all users of the system via a peer-to-peer network.

Using cloud provided wallets, such as www.blockchain.info ( ) , which can be safer for large holdings of crypto than just having it on your own computer, is also not anonymous.

Clearly, this risk could be avoided if the users had access to a trusted ledger with the list of all the transactions. In this case, a transaction would be considered valid only if it is posted on the ledger. For example, suppose the transactions are of a form: ""user A transfers x Bitcoins to user B."" In this case, each user can verify if A really has x Bitcoins (i.e., she received it in some previous transactions) and she did not spend it yet. The functionality of the trusted party emulated by the Bitcoin network does precisely this: it maintains a full list of the transactions that happened in the system. The format of Bitcoin transactions is in fact more complex than in the example above. Since it is of a special interest for us, we describe it in more detail in Section 2.1. However, for the sake of simplicity, we omit the features of Bitcoin that are not relevant to our work such as transaction fees or how the coins are created."

For example, when you transfer money using a bank account your bank updates its ledger to credit and debit accounts accordingly. In this example, there is one central database and the bank is a trusted intermediary who manages it. With a blockchain, this record is shared among all participants in the network. To send bitcoin, for example, an owner publicly broadcasts a transaction to all participants in the network. Participants collectively verify that the transaction indeed took place and update the database accordingly. This record is public, shared by all, and it cannot be amended.

However, it is used in more than just ERC20 tokens. Roulettes, lotteries, and card games can all be implemented using the Ethereum blockchain. Like any blockchain implementation, Ethereum is incorruptible, decentralized, and transparent. Ethereum allows running Turing-complete programs, which are usually written in Solidity, making it a “world supercomputer” in the words of the platform’s founders. All these features are especially beneficial in the context of computer gambling, in which user trust is crucial.

The cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, for example, did not support Bitcoin Cash when it originally forked in August 2017, but did add it to accounts for rightful holders later that year. Is it therefore acceptable to defer income on the fork transaction until the coin holder obtains such access, or later sells the new, forked coins? It seems reasonable to assume that coin traders should not have to report taxable income on a hard fork until the new coin is time-stamped as a ledger entry in the blockchain.

However, becoming active in transactions would reveal your ID. Using cloud provided wallets, such as www.blockchain.info, which can be safer for large holdings of crypto than just having it on your own computer, is also not anonymous. Selling your cryptos for national currencies through an exchange is also not anonymous. More work needs to be done on anonymity if this is a goal.

But still, is it really worth anything at all? It is based on a “blockchain,” a technology that creates a decentralized public ledger and rigorously tracks transfers. It is maintained by its users, and no government can mint more coins. Bitcoin isn’t backed by any sovereign, and unlike a stock or a bond, it gives you a claim to nothing other than Bitcoin itself. Yet that illusory quality is true of most forms of money, a shared hallucination that we tolerate as long as it works. If enough others value something, that can be enough to make it serve as a store of value. Sure, Bitcoin will crash again, but over its lifetime, it has already withstood multiple crashes, runs and splits. It actually feels tested.

Slumping coin prices make it even less expensive, since they cause miners to turn off their machines, leaving networks with less protection.

19.65	2096	[abra bitcoin money barhydt company cash peer]	http://reason.com/blog/2015/05/14/bill-barhydt-abra-bitcoin	Bitcoin, a system of digital currency, has the potential to take the friction out of sending money abroad, but delivering on that potential isn't easy. A conventional money transfer carried out by a bank is a complicated process that take days to complete; Bitcoin utilizes a cryptographically secure ledger called a blockchain that's virtually free to use and clears transactions within minutes. And it's converging with another major trend in technology: In five years, an estimated 80 percent of the world's adults ( ) will own a smartphone, allowing them to send and receive digital money without a traditional bank account. Just as cell phones leapfrogged landlines, Bitcoin and smartphones together could make traditional banking networks unnecessary.

Assume, for example, that there already exists a system like Ripple (or perhaps something based on colored coins) that includes a decentralized exchange between various cryptographic assets. Some might be contracts representing assets like gold or US dollars, others company shares, others smart property and there would obviously also be trust-free cryptocurrency similar to Bitcoin as well. Thus, in order to defraud the system, malicious participants would not simply need to report prices that are slightly incorrect in their favored direction, but would need to push the actual prices of these goods as well – essentially, a LIBOR-style price fixing conspiracy. And, as the experiences of the last few years have shown, LIBOR-style price fixing conspiracies are something that even human-controlled systems cannot necessarily overcome.

MedRec also solves a key issue facing just about anyone who wants to take blockchain outside the realm of digital currency: miners. With Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, miners use computers to perform calculations that verify data on the blockchain—a crucial service that keeps the system functioning. In turn, they’re rewarded with some of that currency (see “ What Bitcoin Is and Why It Matters ( ) ”).

I even wrote a short book ( ) about these groundbreaking possibilities. Considerable publicity has been dedicated to new functionality which promises to expand the extensibility of cryptoprotocols to go beyond tracking ledger entries for just one specific blockchain-managed asset (a coin) and allows users to instead “colored” tokens to represent cars, houses, commodities, stocks, bonds and other financial instruments and wares. For example, there are several colored coin projects currently in beta that allow users to take a fraction of a bitcoin, such as 0.001 BTC and “color” it “blue” (or any other arbitrary color) which represents say, a specific make and model of an automobile like a 2010 Camry LE. The user can then transfer that asset, the title of the Camry, along a cryptoledger (such as the Bitcoin network) to other individuals. Instead of having to transfer tens, hundreds or thousands of bitcoins in exchange for a good or service, users can instead exchange and manage entire asset classes in a trustless, relatively decentralized framework.

President Bukele claims that the government-sponsored Bitcoin wallet already has more users than the entire Salvadoran banking system, potentially throwing a lifeline to thousands of unbanked individuals. These Bitcoin wallets operate partly on the Lightning network, a system that allows for cheaper and faster cryptocurrency transactions. You can now pay instantly with Bitcoin in every Salvadoran McDonald’s and Starbucks, which certainly sounds futuristic and exciting. Still, Bukele has been accused of performing a reckless maneuver to transform the country into a haven for Bitcoin-rich entrepreneurs or even outright criminals, and polls consistently show a majority of Salvadorans fretting about having their salaries paid in volatile bitcoins. Whether Bukele’s crypto gambit will go down in history as the masterstroke of a modernizer or the folly of an autocrat still remains to be seen.

It was just 1500 Bitcoins from their hot wallet and they covered it out of their corporate funds. This did little to affect the general confidence in Bitfinex and it retained its position as one of the largest exchanges. Bitfinex’s position became more complicated when in June of 2016 the CFTC ordered Bitfinex to pay a $75,000 fine for “ offering illegal off-exchange financed retail commodity transactions in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies ( ) “. Part of the issue was that the Bitcoins were not “physically delivered” from the perspective of the CFTC. This may have been a motivating factor for Bitfinex’s switchover to BitGo for their wallet security. BitGo would have allowed for them to segregate each user’s balance ( ) ( archive ( ) ). It was also supposed to provide them with significantly improved multi-signature security. Then they were hacked again in August 2016. This was one of the largest Bitcoin hacks of all time totally 119,756 BTC. In response to this hack, Bitfinex gave the majority of their clients a 30.67% haircut (at least one customer was excluded, Coinbase ( ) [ archive ( ) ]). They credited each customer with a BFX token that represented $1 of the haircut. They said they would pay back all BFX tokens eventually or would offer equity in exchange for them. Bitfinex promised to provide a security audit and a financial audit ( ) ( archive ( ) ). They did not. Many of these BFX tokens were converted to equity in Bitfinex, and these users became passionate advocates for Bitfinex. Eventually all tokens were paid off or converted.

On the other side, when Bitcoin dominance shrinks, people are getting more greedy by investing in more risky alt-coins, dreaming of their chance in next big bull run. Anyhow, analyzing the dominance for a coin other than Bitcoin, you could argue the other way round, since more interest in an alt-coin may conclude a behaviour for that specific coin.

Even though the original whitepaper by “Satoshi Nakamoto” was perhaps ideologically motivated by crypto-libertarianism, the development has since been turned over to a team more concerned with practical adoption than ideological ends. A fiat currency requires a “network effect” to ultimately succeed. Since Bitcoin “mining,” that is the creation of new bitcoins, is (1) an incentive reward for a clearinghouse node completing a proof-of-work requirement for verifying the current block of unverified transactions and given (2) that the increase of CPU power of the Bitcoin network(i.e., the addition of new nodes) dictates that clearinghouse nodes specialize(following a “division of labor” hierarchy) as “number-crunchers,” so most nodes now will no longer participate in block transaction verifications(they will “turn off” the Bitcoin mining option), it follows that (3) most new entrants(new “nodes”) who want to acquire bitcoins will do so by buying them from a currency exchange.

He was invited to speak at the prestigious World Gold Council ( ) conference in Rome, the gold mining industry's leading event.

Confidential transactions hide the amount that is transfered in the transaction. Every confidential transaction contains a cryptographic proof that the transaction is valid. Bulletproofs shrink the size of the cryptographic proof from over 10kB to less than 1kB. Moreover, bulletproofs support proof aggregation, so that proving that m transaction values are valid adds only O (log( m )) additional elements to the size of a single proof. If all Bitcoin transactions were confidential and used Bulletproofs, then the total size of the UTXO set would be only 17 GB, compared to 160 GB with the currently used proofs.

And when you finally use Bitcoin to pay for goods and services, you will of course need to provide your name and address to the seller for delivery purposes. It means that a third party can trace your transactions and find ID information. To avoid this, such mixing service provide the ability to exchange your bitcoins for different ones which cannot be associated with the original owner.

Instead of offering community-responsive development, crypto diplomacy will pry open economies for super-rich investors searching for fiscal wildernesses to tame. Some risk-entrepreneurs are already receiving transaction commissions, earning on wallet and service adoption. Governments, too, will be able to acquire key information on the financial habits of crypto users by simply reviewing the public ledger – streamlining the mechanisms of state surveillance. For El Salvador, this is pure capitalism delivered through cryptography, where the daydream of laissez-faire decentralization masks an unsettling authoritarian creep.

The official block is then added to previous blocks, creating an ever-lengthening chain of blocks, called the “blockchain,” that serves as a master ledger for all bitcoin transactions. (Most cryptocurrencies have their own blockchain.) And, importantly, the winning miner is rewarded with brand-new bitcoins (when Carlson got started, in mid-2012, the reward was 50 bitcoins) and all the processing fees. The network then moves on to the next batch of payments and the process repeats—and, in theory, will keep repeating, once every 10 minutes or so, until miners mine all 21 million of the bitcoins programmed into the system.

33.88	426	[bitcoin mines power mining xingzhe users transaction]	https://theweek.com/captured/718731/inside-secret-chinese-bitcoin-mine	" XINGZHE/CHINAFILE)Much of bitcoin's allure comes from its intense level of decentralization. But like any monetary system, bitcoin still requires checks and balances, validation and verification.That's where ""mining"" comes in.Bitcoin users are tasked with keeping their own ledger of every single transaction that occurs in the system, including the ones they're not involved in. To keep everyone's records updated and in sync, thousands of power users — called ""miners"" — confirm each transaction's validity in real time, essentially by solving complicated algorithms. Miners then send out the verified information to the network.Mining is a competition, of sorts. Miners use special computer programs to solve the series of codes and functions that make up the highly encrypted transaction data. The first person to get through is rewarded with new bitcoins. Notably, solving the functions relies more on chance and processing power than the miner himself, making it more of a lottery than a math test.So to be successful, a bitcoin miner needs two things: an array of supercomputers and the massive amount of electricity needed to fuel them.That's why despite bitcoin's global accessibility, China has emerged as the cryptocurrency's leader. By manufacturing most of the world's mining equipment and building massive mines that take advantage of cheap electricity, China has more bitcoin processing power than any other country, by a huge margin."

15.90	632	[energy iot power plant blockchain poole hunter]	https://www.cnet.com/news/blockchain-coal-power-plant-mining-bitcoin-cryptocurrency/	There's been huge interest around the world lately in bitcoin ( ) , an electronic alternative to government-issued money, not least of all for its get-rich-quick allure. But as its value has soared -- and plunged -- it's sometimes been hard to separate the sensible from the scams ( ) among the 1,500 other cryptocurrencies. Blockchain ( ) , the technology that underlies cryptocurrencies, is a decentralized and encrypted way of recording transactions, synchronizing that activity and distributing the record of it across potentially thousands of computers.
30.26	272	[mining energy bitcoin uses narayanan electricity cryptocurrency]	https://theoutline.com/post/6047/bitcoin-mining-accounts-for-almost-one-percent-of-the-worlds-energy-consumption	It is well-established established that Bitcoin mining — aka, donating one’s computing power to keep a cryptocurrency network up and running in exchange for a chance to win some free crypto — uses a lot of electricity ( ). Companies involved in large-scale mining operations know that this is a problem, and they’ve tried to employ various solutions ( ) for making the process more energy efficient.

The point of the P2P bitcoin network is the generation and maintenance of that ledger, and technically anyone can contribute updates—those recordings of transactions are blocks in the chain. But there’s a catch. (This was the bit of genius in bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto ( ) ’s pitch, whoever the almost certainly psuedonymous “Satoshi Nakamoto” is or are.) In order to contribute a block, you also have to solve some really hard math, a “hashing algorithm” called SHA-256. 1

That said, the road ahead is fraught. Compared to Liberty, Bitcoin is an even more decentralized type of digital currency known as a cryptocurrency. It has no central controlling authority. (Meaning, among other things, it is not overseen by a pack of indictable idiots, as was Liberty ( ).) It is distributed by countless “miners” scattered across the globe. (For a bit more on the regulatory challenges, see here ( ).) And while Bitcoin transactions are currently more public, and thus more traceable, than those in some other networks, laundering services have sprung up to help mask money trails, and code is in the works to render transactions wholly untraceable. (One such add-on, Zerocoin, debuted at a San Francisco symposium ( ) in May.)
39.78	631	[bitcoin transactions zerocoin users trace systems security]	https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/29/bitcoin-is-not-anonymous-but-it-could-be/	Bitcoin operates with greater transparency than those systems. It may be fully decentralized and requires no central bank or government authority, but Bitcoin transactions are as public — if not more so — than any other payment network. Each transaction is recorded in a public ledger, called a “block chain,” to keep people from writing the digital equivalent of a bad check. That public block chain makes it possible to trace transactions, even years after they have transpired. In one case, researchers were able to trace the spending of 25,000 stolen Bitcoins in 2011.

It is made possible by a distributed network that both produces Bitcoins, and at the same time verifies each transaction taking place. Since they are wholly virtual, Bitcoins are not backed, nor controlled, by any government or corporation; allowing instant payments with nearly zero fees available to everyone with internet connection. As with gold, Bitcoins are recognisable, divisible and limited, but also much easier to transport. Although, just like the internet and its apparent virtuality, the processes required to create and exchange cryptocurrencies are done at a real-world site. Even the ‘invisible’ needs a physical infrastructure.

At its heart is a huge distributed computing network that verifies each transaction.

These scripting languages allow you to do smart contracts where coins can be spent under conditions like timelock ( ) , multiparty, delay, random numbers, or some other .... everybody downloads, everyone verifies.... ings... so they can't really be compressed or aggregated in any coherent or consistent way. They actually end up being hashed, so they can't really be compressed. It just doesn't work, without breaking the hashes, it just doesn't work. Secondly, the details of these scripts are public, they are visible to everyone forever and they have to be stored. This means different outputs in bitcoin, or different accounts in ethereum, are not very fungible or private because you can tell what the rules are on each individual coin and you can distinguish ebtween coins and track all this cool stuff, because of individual scripts moving coins around.

This near-majority stake had bitcoin bugs concerned. Bitcoin works because there is a huge public log ( ) of every bitcoin transaction, and that log is written by miners, who keep it honest by checking each other. But if a single group is mostly responsible for writing and checking that log, that group could in theory cook the books to give its members bitcoins that aren’t theirs. That would completely undermine bitcoin.

In particular, for $299 they offer a mini-computer that can be used to run a Bitcoin or Monero full node in addition to the other DAppNode core packages. This allows them to offer a far more powerful system than Casa at a better price point.

This was mostly due to the limited amount of coins due to slow mining generation rates. The price of Auroracoin began to slowly rise about a day after trading began, and by March 3 a rally was underway. It was a classic pump, big investors (called whales) bought large amounts of Auroracoin, feeding a frenzy of speculation by small to medium investors. The price reached an incredible 0.138 Bitcoin per Auroracoin on March 4, or about $70 at the time.

For the currency to be viable, the miners need to be compensated for their efforts. Bitcoin miners are compensated through two mechanisms: they collect the transaction fees from the transactions recorded in the new block they contributed to the block chain, and they also collect a lump sum fee. This lump sum fee creates new Bitcoins, according to a time-varying formula. Hence, ""mining"" is similar to digging for gold -- every now and then, a miner is rewarded with a nugget. The difficulty of crypto-puzzles are automatically adjusted such that a new block is added to the ledger approximately every 10 minutes, which ensures a predictable coin generation rate for the system, which stems inflation and makes the currency supply more predictable than it would be otherwise."

Bitcoin is, in effect, a giant shared transaction ledger, recording who owns each individual unit of the currency at any one time. Everyone must use the same copy of the ledger—known as the “blockchain”—to prevent the same coins from being spent twice. The flaw, known as “transaction malleability”, muddles up the ledger so that successful Bitcoin payments do not appear to have been made. This could make it possible for hackers to trick badly-coded software—such as the proprietary Bitcoin wallets used by some exchanges—into sending money repeatedly.

39.41	926	[wax nfts carbon ethereum energy blockchain nft]	https://wax-io.medium.com/wax-celebrates-earth-month-9f3164749e46	Ethereum and Bitcoin blockchains operate on a proof of work system ( ) (PoW) system. PoW systems use a massive amount of energy to process transactions as miners compete to solve complex equations (i.e. the proof of work problem). The first computer to solve these math problems is compensated with valuable tokens. As the value of ETH and BTC tokens have risen over time, crypto miners have invested in ever more powerful mining rigs to more rapidly solve the blockchain proof of work problems. WAX is built around an entirely different transaction validation design, a delegated proof of stake system ( ) (DPoS). William Quigley, co-founder of WAX says, “WAX was designed from the beginning to be incredibly energy efficient. That is why WAX NFTs use a tiny fraction of the energy of Ethereum and Bitcoin. In fact, WAX is 125,000 times more energy-efficient than Ethereum and WAX is already carbon neutral”. With WAX DPoS, transactions are approved by 21 energy-efficient guilds delegated with that responsibility by WAX token holders. WAX token holders who stake their tokens are eligible to vote for their preferred guilds. Under WAX DPoS, there is no battle for computing power dominance as there is with Ethereum and Bitcoin PoW chains. This means that while Ethereum and Bitcoin grow in terawatts of energy each month, the energy consumption on the WAX blockchain is relatively stable.

Long ago, Bitcoin’s implausibly mysterious progenitor Satoshi Nakamoto added a last-minute size limitation to the cryptocurrency’s “blocks” of transactions (which in turn make up its now-famous “blockchain.”) This was intended as a temporary ( ) anti-spam measure.

18.59	1041	[bitcoin financial assets services decentralization trust systems]	http://bluematt.bitcoin.ninja/2016/01/14/decentralization/	In a world where no Bitcoin miners have more than 1% of total hash power (or something else equivalently decentralized), it should be easy to find a miner which is either anonymous and accepting all transactions or in a jurisdiction which is not attempting to censor your transactions. Of course this isn’t the world we have today, and transaction censorship is one of the bigger reasons to be seriously concerned with mining centralization (for full nodes). Still, the ability of an individual to purchase hashpower (in the form of readily-available old hardware or in the form of renting it) to mine their otherwise-censored transaction is an option as long as the longest-chain rule remains in place across miners. While significantly more expensive than it would be in a truly-decentralized Bitcoin, this does allow Bitcoin to retain some of its anti-censorship properties.
19.71	12458	[bitcoin think mike post hearn core money]	http://avc.com/2016/01/bitcoin-is-dead-long-live-bitcoin/	IMO the biggest obstacle is the centralization of mining power in China. I have spent a lot of time in China and half of my family is Chinese. The fact that Chinese miners have a short-term economic incentive to keep small blocks, coupled with a reticence to abandon the Core Dev team may prove disastrous.Ethereum has already run txn rates that exceed the capacity of bitcoin. If I was Brian Armstrong, I would get ETH trading on the Coinbase exchange. It is very likely that ETH will grow as a cryptocurrency. It would also plant the seeds for a plan B for CB, which relies upon VISA scale. Finally, it would be a shot across the bow to the small block advocates, which might precipitate a resolution sooner than later.At any rate, with the bitcoin reward halving and ethereum moving to PoS, it is going to be a very interesting year for blockchains.

One question I did have about what you mentioned in the beginning, about the over-arching of where Bitcoin should be in the long-term. What are your thoughts on, if miner rewards go to zero, and transaction fees don't go up-- what if miners are paid only by US dollar appreciation of BTC? So price should increase assuming the usage of bitcoin and demand will sort of static.

The obvious difference between a DO and a DAO, and the one inherent in the language, is the word “autonomous”; that is, in a DO the humans are the ones making the decisions, and a DAO is something that, in some fashion, makes decisions for itself. This is a surprisingly tricky distinction to define because, as dictatorships are always keen to point out, there is really no difference between a certain set of actors making decisions directly and that set of actors controlling all of the information through which decisions are made. In Bitcoin, a 51% attack between a small number of mining pools can make the blockchain reverse transactions, and in a hypothetical decentralized autonomous corporation the providers of the data inputs can all collude to make the DAC think that sending all of its money to1FxkfJQLJTXpW6QmxGT6oF43ZH959ns8Cq constitutes paying for a million nodes’ worth of computing power for ten years. However, there is obviously a meaningful distinction between the two, and so we do need to define it.

The launch of the CBOE ( ) futures contracts, surging demand for Bitcoin, and overwhelmed crypto exchanges have highlighted some inherent problems with BTC.

Tesla estimates that a $100 deposit paid today equals 0.00183659 BTC, for example.

Recall that block creation or “mining” in bitcoin and Ethereum uses a proof-of-work scheme, in which a mathematical problem must be solved in order to generate a block and claim its reward. The value of this reward inevitably turns mining into an arms race, with miners competing to solve the problems faster. To compensate, the network periodically adjusts the difficulty to maintain a constant rate of block creation, once every 10 minutes in bitcoin or 15 seconds in Ethereum.

Like all smart contracts in Ethereum, The DAO is just a piece of computer code, which is “immutably” (i.e. permanently and irreversibly) embedded in the blockchain and executed by every node in response to incoming transactions. And like any self-respecting smart contract, The DAO provides full transparency by making its source code easily accessible online. This means that anybody can independently verify its functionality but also, crucially, look for vulnerabilities. And yet, the immutable nature of blockchains prevents any such problems from being fixed.

Their primary purpose today, and I believe in future as well, is to let people buy their way out of the penny flooding protections Bitcoin has. In an ideal world most transactions would in fact be free. Only wallets that send transactions very rapidly (e.g. exchange wallets) would have to pay fees. Miners would include free transactions ordered by “priority” as they do today (calculated as coin age times value), and they’d do it because circulating bitcoins are valuable bitcoins. Additionally the psychological difference between “Bitcoin has no fees” and “Bitcoin has tiny fees” is significant.

Feeling richer, holders of ether started investing in what have come to be called initial coin offerings. Startups sell “tokens”, sub-currencies of sorts, which exist on top of Ethereum. A total of 38 such ICOs have already been launched this year, raising more than $150m, according to Smith+Crown, a research firm. This has lured even more money into crypto-currencies. Some of the gains have found their way back into bitcoin and alt.coins. Trading between crypto-currencies has grown tenfold to $2bn on average a day, says Erik Voorhees, the founder of ShapeShift, a crypto-to-crypto exchange.

These are a form of money (bitcoin and ether are examples) used in transactions which are recorded on a distributed public ledger called a blockchain. An ICO is a scheme to raise funds for an enterprise written into a contract on a blockchain. To buy in, punters use cryptocurrency to pay for tokens. Those tokens become the working currency within the new enterprise. A new social network, for instance, might fund itself through an ICO, then allow users to spend their tokens on goods or services on the network once it is up and running. In successful projects, demand for tokens should rise and early investors should profit. ICOs resemble both a new form of crowdfunding, and a technological leapfrog over the regulations that hem in more orthodox funding strategies. They are also all the rage. Ether, the currency used on the ethereum blockchain, is up by more than 2,400% against the dollar over the past year and boasts a market capitalisation of nearly $28bn. ICOs have so far raised nearly $2bn in 2017.

NFTs operate on a blockchain, which is a publicly accessible and transparent network — meaning anyone can see the details of any NFT transaction. Computers involved in the transactions become part of the network, which keeps updating and can’t be hacked due its nature as many-headed hydra. In the case of NFTs, their value becomes subjective and therefore fluctuates, kind of like stocks. (To learn more about the subject, read Rolling Stone ‘s guide to crypto in music ( ).)

A more likely scenario is that the technology that underpins bitcoin—a distributed ledger called the blockchain—proves so useful that it becomes widely adopted. If so, bitcoin would become a vehicle for other services, and people would need to own some, or a fraction of one, to use them. But the original appeal of bitcoin was to the libertarian fringe and those who wanted to trade illegal commodities, like drugs, out of sight of the authorities. Bitcoin’s anonymity and opacity do not much appeal to big banks (or to their regulators). They are developing their own blockchains.

First everything is done using discrete transactions, either to make or to receive a payment across a Nostro account. Second, ideally everything is (or should be) done in real-time, with an immediate confirmation that a transaction has been accepted and acted upon.  Third, there is no central authority, as all transactions are naturally peer-to peer. And in general (but not always [ii] ( ) ) transactions are irrevocable.

In short, if any mining entity has 51% control of the compute input that runs bitcoin, it could block transactions, double spend, and more.

Ethereum’s claim to fame is that it is also a platform for “smart contracts”—business rules encapsulated in software. Most ICO tokens, for instance, are issued by such contracts. Its success has attracted crypto-copycats: Cardano ($20bn) and NEO ($8bn), a Chinese version.

Crypto-entrepreneurs have made and lost ( ) millions, and many people have parlayed their trading into a full-time job. But blockchain technology, which allows for immutable records of activities, stored on a ledger that is held not just in one place but massively distributed, has applications in every conceivable area in commerce and beyond.

Asa mining becomes more difficult and less profitable unless continuous new investments take place, the price per existing bitcoin should go up in value. Moreover, with “only” 4.2 million coins to be generated after January 2018 = over the course of nearly 122 years – the demand for bitcoin should increase as well. However, neither of these factors are  a given, as the cryptocurrency market does not operate like more traditional models.

Underpinning this technology is the blockchain. Miners, who use heavy-duty processors to solve the difficult computational problems necessary to string together transactions in clusters, or “blocks”, which constitute the “chain”, are rewarded for their efforts with coins. By forcing miners all over the world to compete for coins by algorithmically contributing to the blockchain, the ledger for transactions is both decentralised and unhackable.

The extreme is an approach where oracles also decide the one thing that the Bitcoin-based schemes still leave the blockchain to decide: the order of transactions. If we abandon this requirement, then it is possible to achieve much higher degrees of efficiency by having an oracle maintain a centralized database of transactions and state as they come, providing a signed record of each new balance sheet as a transaction is applied, allowing for applications like microtransactions and high-frequency trading. However, this has obvious trust-problems; particularly, what if the oracle double-spends?"

Ethereum (ETH), the second largest cryptocurrency by market value, processes more than twice as many transactions ( ) as the bitcoin network while using only about one-third of the electricity consumed by bitcoin ( ). ETH also operates on a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism, but its founder has announced plans to move to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) ( ) in an effort to reduce its energy intensity. PoS and Proof‑of‑Authority ( ) (PoA) could help reduce energy use ( ) while also addressing scalability ( ) and latency ( ) issues. Other DLTs like Tangle and Hashgraph ( ) similarly offer the promise of lower energy use, scalability, faster transactions, and no transaction fees compared to blockchain.

Although it is important to note that this is indeed a stress test scenario where users are incentivized to dump transactions on the blockchain paying only the free test-ether as a transaction fee, and transaction throughput levels are thus several times higher than Bitcoin, it is nevertheless a legitimate concern for users, who in many cases do not have hundreds of gigabytes to spare on storing other people’s transaction histories.

This has led to Ethereum becoming the home of decentralised finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).
23.66	4571	[code ethereum dao smart contracts contract blockchain]	https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/smart-contracts-dao-implosion-gideon-greenspan	Ironically, the individual or group which drained The DAO did so by exploiting subtle errors in this withdrawal mechanism. Like all smart contracts in Ethereum, The DAO is just a piece of computer code, which is “immutably” (i.e. permanently and irreversibly) embedded in the blockchain and executed by every node in response to incoming transactions. And like any self-respecting smart contract, The DAO provides full transparency by making its source code easily accessible online. This means that anybody can independently verify its functionality but also, crucially, look for vulnerabilities. And yet, the immutable nature of blockchains prevents any such problems from being fixed.

This über-blockchain would be infinitely extendible, limited only by the imagination of those using it. The world of crypto-enthusiasts was almost unanimously convinced by this powerful idea. And so, with $18 million in crowd funding ( ) and to great excitement, Ethereum was born.

However, validators also have reduced returns from causing other, slower validators to fall out of sync, so they will allow the gas limit to rise only in a manner that is tolerable by the other validators. Miners investing in hardware primarily purchase more mining rigs, while validators investing in hardware primarily upgrade their servers so they can process more transactions per second. Miners also have an incentive to reinvest in more powerful transaction processing, but this incentive is much weaker than their incentive to purchase mining power.

A log is collectively maintained of all transactions, with every new transaction broadcast across the Bitcoin network. Participating machines communicate to create and agree on updates to the official log. This process, which is computationally intensive, is in fact the process used to mine Bitcoins: roughly every 10 minutes, a user whose updates to the log have been approved by the network is awarded a fixed number of new Bitcoins.

It seemed to show a mountain of evidence that Wright, a computer security researcher and entrepreneur, had conceived of the cryptocurrency that would become bitcoin, released it with the help of his friend and confidant Dave Kleiman, and run a collection of computers to generate the more than one million coins believed to be held by Satoshi Nakamoto.

Those leaks led us to other independent evidence: three posts on Wright's blog hinted at bitcoin's creation and launch, a document on an accounting firm's website showed Wright invested a suspiciously large sum of bitcoins into one of his companies, and another of his firms claimed ownership of two cryptocurrency-related supercomputers that were listed in the official Top 500 list of the world's most powerful.

An effective reputation system will be required for measuring quality-of-service (eg. a node up 99% of the time is worth at least 3x more than a node up 50% of the time). In some ways, incentivized file storage even depends on effective blockchain scalability; having to implicitly pay for the fees of 343 transactions going to verification contracts every hour is not going to work until transaction fees become far lower than they are today, and until then some more coarse-grained compromises are going to be required. But then again, pretty much every problem in the cryptocurrency space still has a very long way to go.

38.58	429	[bitcoin mining miners transactions solution puzzle power]	https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/01/economist-explains-11	The aim of bitcoin—as envisaged by Satoshi Nakamoto, its elusive creator—is to provide a way to exchange tokens of value online without having to rely on centralised intermediaries, such as banks. Instead the necessary record-keeping is decentralised into a “blockchain”, an ever-expanding ledger that holds the transaction history of all bitcoins in circulation, and lives on the thousands of machines on the bitcoin network. But if there is no central authority, who decides which transactions are valid and should be added to the blockchain? And how is it possible to ensure that the system cannot be gamed, for example by spending the same bitcoin twice? The answer is mining.

Basically, the first computer that solves each new block gets Bitcoins (or a fraction of one) as a reward. Ethereum does not offer block rewards and instead allows miners to take a transaction fee.
33.29	1768	[ethereum bitcoin blockchain ether users set applications]	http://www.mining.com/web/history-ethereum-set-overtake-bitcoin-2018/	Inside the Ethereum network, all transaction fees are collected by the nodes that validate the network. These nodes make up what is now termed as “miners”. Ethereum miners group all transactions and put them together into “blocks” and then competitively put them in line to feature in the next blockchain. For every successful block mined, miners are rewarded with Ether. This endeavor creates a market where people dedicate their resources in exchange for Ethereum’s value-token.

He called it Ethereum. Rather than being a Swiss Army knife of separate tools, Ethereum would be simple: It would combine a bitcoin-like network with a universal programming language that would allow users to invent whatever tools they want. These tools would be able to interact with one another and conduct transactions with a common currency called ether. In the white paper, he described Ethereum as a “Lego of cryptofinance.” With it, all the imagined potential of bitcoin could be put to use in one place — plus a lot of the not-yet-imagined potential too.

Even Mark Cuban, who has been investing in the NFT space ( ) , sold a tweet ( ) on Valuables for 0.56 ETH, or $953 at the time. Dorsey’s NFT sold for 1630 ETH, which was worth about $2.9 million at the time of sale. He donated the proceeds to GiveDirectly to aid the COVID-19 response in Africa, but NFTs are still often criticized for their negative environmental impact ( ) — others worry that the NFT market could just be a flash in the pan. But with major platforms like Twitter making NFTs, the fad might not be over just yet — or, Twitter could be testing the waters to gauge how its userbase reacts to an impromptu, free NFT drop before expanding its offerings in the space.

To keep financial records secure, the system forces people to solve complex puzzles using energy-guzzling machines. Solving the puzzles lets users, or “miners,” add a new “block” of verified transactions to a decentralized ledger called the blockchain. The miner then gets new tokens or transaction fees as a reward. The process is incredibly energy inefficient on purpose. The idea is that using up inordinate amounts of electricity — and probably paying a lot for it — makes it less profitable for someone to muck up the ledger. As a result, Ethereum uses about as much electricity as the entire country of Libya ( ).

To fully understand the carbon footprint of an NFT requires a fair amount of information. In the simplest terms, NFTs are blockchain-based tokens that are paired with anything digital like artwork, music, and videos, and they cannot be duplicated, which creates scarcity and authenticity. NFTs are minted, meaning created, on a blockchain and some currencies, like Ethereum, can have contracts written into them. These contracts can say many different things such as the artist receives a portion of any future sale or that the artwork can change over time. Cryptocurrencies are supported by a huge network of computers, called miners, that work in order to establish blockchains for transactions. Blockchain transactions inherently include a digital ledger that (in theory) cannot be altered or undone. In traditional art terms, an NFT blockchain is comparable to provenance in that it documents and verifies ownership, sale price, and location or wallet address. That’s the simple explanation.

From a report: The wettest weather in at least 20 years boosted production from hydro-electric plants, leaving Sweden and Norway with some of the lowest power prices in the world. The resulting glut in the most important raw material for making the virtual coins coincided with a year when the price of Bitcoin almost quadrupled. The currencies are made in giant computer farms that process complex algorithms in halls as big as airport hangars. That makes electricity one of the key inputs, with operations sometimes consuming as much power as that used by 70,000 households. The current market dynamics give big miners alternatives to places where Bitcoin are usually created such as China, Kazakhstan and Canada.

Just like bitcoin, lots and lots of people run the software, and get a few tokens (ether) for doing it. Those computers in the network all work together and share a common database, called the blockchain. Bitcoin’s blockchain stores financial transactions. Ethereum’s blockchain stores smart contracts. You don’t rent space in a data center and hire a bunch of system administrators.

The answer is: this is quite possible, but transaction fees are not expected to be any less volatile. They were certainly less volatile back in 2011-2017, but that was only because blocks were not full (for bitcoin or ethereum), and so de-facto fees were centrally planned by core devs and miners who adjusted them downwards in response to public pressure every time the fees got too high; with full blocks this is not possible, and so tx fees are even more volatile ( ) than prices ( ).

When you pay for something with a bitcoin, a payment processor will check the blockchain to make sure you own the bitcoins you're trying to use, then write the new transaction into the ledger. Because so many copies of the ledger exist across the Internet, you can't cheat the blockchain by altering a single copy. Hyperledger is similar, Krishna explains, but adds more features for verifying the identity of the people you're trading with—imperative for larger companies and governments.

With Bitcoin, and with colored coins ( ) and alternative currencies, even instant transactions have a certain degree of security. Bitcoin nodes refuse to propagate transactions that are incompatible with transactions that they have already seen, so if an attacker attempts to send money to a merchant and then immediately send another transaction sending the same money back to themselves the second transaction will be rejected by the network. With colored coins, the situation is the same, and alternative cryptocurrencies also benefit from this mechanism.

Perhaps anonymous is the wrong way to describe Bitcoins; Bitcoins have a strong potential for anonymity. They are pseudo-anonymous.

While either of these pieces of information could be used to identify a single person as owning a specific wallet, they do not necessarily identify that person. A cash-to-Bitcoin ( ) transaction, when combined with a WiFi hotspot or VPN ( ) , is essentially untraceable. In fact, this is why the Bitcoin platform has become widely used for money laundering ( ) and other criminal activity ( ).

CryptoCribs was a magically vibrant homesharing marketplace, that we built in the summer of 2017 on a fairly modern tech stack (Node.js, React, GraphQL, Express, Web3.js). It launched a decade after Airbnb with the honest intention of bringing back the community spirit to homesharing. During our time at the rodeo, our platform enabled hundreds of stays in more than 250 cities across all continents. We spent zero dollars on marketing and relied on the sheer wildfire of early enthusiasts: ""Wow... I can't tell you how thankful I am for your platform. I have met so many amazing people on this journey and my hosts here couldn't have been more amazing! Thank you so much for this insanely great platform. I really applaud you for putting it together so well and not opting for an ICO or token-based system of exchange."" We also believed in freedom, integrity and sarcasm and stuff. Brian Armstrong, co-founder of Coinbase, was a strong supporter of our mission and with his team's help we ended up being one of the first Dapps to go live on Coinbase Toshi (now Coinbase Wallet). If you want to talk to us, we're still around somewhere on the internet. Email us at erasmus@cryptocribs.com or serge@cryptocribs.com.

Retailers are as gung-ho about the technology behind Bitcoin as any cryptobro on Twitter, and these aren’t just random stores investing in Bitcoin—huge players like Overstock.com have also enthusiastically gotten into the mix. “We think (with no hyperbole) that blockchain technology will have a greater impact on society than the internet has had once the full potential of the technology is realized,” Jonathan Johnson, the president of Overstock's blockchain-investing arm Medici Ventures, tells me over email.

If those consensus rules are expected to broaden (as with a hard-fork), those merchants need to accept payments made under the new set of rules, or they will reject ""bitcoins"" as invalid. Holders are relevant to the degree in that they choose the merchants they wish to spend their bitcoins with, and could also as a whole decide to sell under one set of consensus rules or the other, thus flooding the market with bitcoins and crashing the price."

Second, IOHK wants to dispel the myth that ETC is a “copy and paste” coin that uses other people's code, and show that it is an independent and viable alternative to Ethereum. Third, the client is built in Scala, which is a functional programming language that offers security guarantees that other languages do not.

While Bitcoin doesn't have any formal transaction fees, transacting in Bitcoins carries risks that dealing in dollars or euros does not. If users store Bitcoins on their PCs, there's a risk that malware will gain access to their wallets and steal their funds.

One interesting example of an alternative was the airdrop of the UNI token ( ) , a governance token used for the Uniswap protocol, popular with those invested in the Decentralised Finance space. On September 16, 2020 this decentralised exchange on the Ethereum blockchain created the UNI governance token to be used by token holders to vote on the direction of the project. Although not technically a DAO, 60% of the total supply was allocated to users based on their use of Uniswap, in which a user that had used the platform only one time could claim 400 tokens, worth over $1000 at the time ( ). While the broader crypto community characterised this approach as innovative, this is not unlike what many consumer coops do for profit sharing with their consumer members.

In a DAO, this ownership is registered through token-based governance rather than in shares of stock. DAOs are different from cooperatives, because they exist on the blockchain—a ledger of transactions that publicly records every time cryptocurrency changes hands. DAOs are part of a new collection of Internet structures called “Web3,” which includes virtual environments, digital art known as “nonfungible tokens” (NFTs), and cryptocurrencies. I think Jin was wrong about unions: If you are working in the digital economy, you should still organize your workplace—but you should also join a DAO.
