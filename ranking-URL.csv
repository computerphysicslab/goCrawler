This is concordant with recent clinical observations which show that COVID-19 exhibits a reduced interferon response in comparison to other respiratory viruses such as influenza and SARS.

Studies now consistently ( ) indicate that infectivity starts before symptoms do ( ) , that it peaks right around the day that they start, and that it declines substantially by five days or so. This is the pattern we see in influenza. But it’s the opposite of the pattern we saw with the coronavirus that caused China’s SARS outbreak eighteen years ago. That virus had a low risk of transmission until after five days from the onset of symptoms, which made it easier to identify and isolate cases before others got infected. No large-scale lockdown was necessary. It seems that there are also plenty of people who are infected by the virus that causes COVID -19 who never become symptomatic, especially children. So far, studies of transmission networks have not revealed such silent carriers to be a major source of spread. Nonetheless, patients who do not yet show symptoms, or have just begun to, are turning out to be important vectors of disease.

63.52	1092	[spread pandemic health disease masks virus know]	https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/nine-important-things-weve-learned-about-the-coronavirus-pandemic-so-far/	*Misinformation kills.* The president of the United States, other politicians, anti-vaccine activists ( ) , and members of the right-wing media, to their everlasting shame, have used the pandemic to stoke racism, spread misinformation and amplify conspiracy theories. Their followers have threatened health officials, including Tony Fauci and his family ( ) ; refused to wear masks; refused to cooperate with contact tracers ( ) ; and rejected proven basic public health advice about social distancing. Representative Louie Gohmert, who refused to wear a mask in the Capitol and reportedly discouraged his staff and interns ( ) from wearing masks, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 ( ) and is being treated with hydroxychloroquine ( ) , a drug that Trump has endorsed but that has failed in clinical trials ( ). Trump supporter Herman Cain died of COVID-19 ( ) on July 30, weeks after attending a rally in Tulsa without a mask. Calls to poison-control centers spiked ( ) after Trump speculated that injecting or ingesting disinfectants could protect against the coronavirus. Early evidence suggests people who watched Fox News were more likely to downplay the pandemic ( ) , worsening the spread ( ). The most important public health measure during a pandemic of a disease with no cure or vaccine—as many countries around the world that have controlled the virus have shown—is to help experts share clear, trustworthy, accurate, actionable information ( ) based on the best evidence. Spreading lies has spread this disease.

The health, social, and economic impact of this disease is unprecedented in our life-time. The COVID-19 pandemic has collapsed health care systems and led to an overwhelming pressure on Intensive Care Units (ICUs), since many patients developed profound hypoxemia and extensive pulmonary infiltrates requiring intubation and ventilatory support [ 2 ( ) ].

FluMist, for example, contains weakened flu viruses, and a handful of research groups ( ) are looking into the strategy for COVID-19. But live virus vaccines are riskier because, well, the virus is live. “We don’t want to be spraying coronavirus up people’s noses until [we] are absolutely sure that it’s actually a virus that can’t spread from person to person and that it can’t make somebody sick,” says Kathleen Neuzil ( ) , the director of the University of Maryland’s Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health. “It will just take time.”

A COVID-19 vaccine may prove to be more like the vaccines that protect against influenza: a critical public health tool that reduces the risk of contracting the disease, experiencing its most severe symptoms, and dying from it, but that does not completely prevent the spread of the virus. Nevertheless, given the potential of vaccines to end or contain the most deadly pandemic in a century, world leaders as varied as French President Emmanuel Macron, Chinese President Xi Jinping, and UN Secretary-General António Guterres have referred ( ) to them as global public goods—a resource to be made available to all, with the use of a vaccine in one country not interfering with its use in another.

For example, during the response to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 ( ) , the country prioritized population health over concerns for the economic impact of its response. Officials deployed a multi-sector response incorporating military, public security services and grassroot organizations while ensuring that transparent risk communication and effective community mobilization were emphasized throughout the outbreak. These lessons were certainly pulled into its current strategy. The country has also faced other outbreaks ( ) from which it drew similar lessons including Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, avian influenza, measles and dengue. Partners such as Gavi and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( ) have also invested in the country’s health system capacities long-term.

This novel corona virus SARS-CoV-2 has a specific tropism for the low respiratory airways, but causes severe pneumonia in a low percentage of patients. However, the rapid spread of the infection during this pandemic is causing the need to hospitalize a high number of patients. Pneumonia in COVID-19 has peculiar features and can be studied by lung ultrasound in the early approach to suspected patients. The sonographic signs are non-specific when considered alone, but observation of some aspects of vertical artifacts can enhance the diagnostic power of the ultrasound examination. Also, the combination of sonographic signs in patterns and their correlation with blood exams in different phenotypes of the disease may allow for a reliable characterization and be of help in triaging and admitting patients.

Nasal respiratory epithelial cells and olfactory epithelial support cells have been shown to express high levels of ACE2 proteins used by the SARS-Cov2 virus, which causes the COVID-19 syndrome, to infect cells [ 2 ( ) ]. Previously described human strains of coronavirus have also been demonstrated to invade the central nervous system and propagate from within the olfactory bulb [ 3 ( ) ]. It is therefore perhaps no surprise that alterations in sense of smell would be reported by patients with COVID-19.

This virus genetically is very similar to a bat coronavirus in the subgenus Sarbecovirus [ 2 ( ) ]. The WHO named the disease as COVID-19 [ 3 ( ) ] and it spread all over the world rapidly less than 3 month s. corona viruses can be classified into four genera (α, β, γ, and δ) and they are detected in a very wide selection of animal species, including humans [ 4 ( ) ]. The virus that causes the COVID-19 infection belongs to the β coronaviruses family. Since the beginning of the twenty-first century, three coronaviruses crossed the species barrier and causes deadly pneumonia in humans: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [ 5 ( ) ], Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus [ 6 ( ) ], and SARS-CoV-2 [ 7 ( ) ]. Unlike previous coronaviruses that caused large-scale epidemics such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), the transmission rate for COVID-19 is much higher [ 8 ( ) ]. Due to the high rate of contagious and highly nonspecific symptoms of this disease such as respiratory symptoms, cough, dyspnea, fever, and viral pneumonia [ 7 ( ) ], the establishment of precise and fast diagnostic tests are urgently required to verify suspected cases, screen patients, and conduct virus surveillance.

And in the U.S., the testing fiasco has only amplified that uncertainty. How many people have the new coronavirus? How many people will become infected and never know? How likely are they to spread it? What role do children play? What is the actual death rate? These are crucial data, and we simply don’t have reliable estimates right now ( ). In addition, how societies behave feeds back into the epidemic’s severity, adding another layer of uncertainty. The way the virus behaves in China or Italy will be different from how it behaves here, depending on what we do. The only thing we know for sure is that things continue to change rapidly, which also means that in these circumstances, anyone claiming certainty is suspect.

Although the World Health Organization (WHO) agrees the compounds are worth testing more fully on the pandemic coronavirus, few drug or infectious disease experts—not even the president’s own advisers—share his optimism that the drugs could become “one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine,” as he tweeted.

46.32	1192	[cov sars shc014 ma15 urbani cells covs]	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26552008/	The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV underscores the threat of cross-species transmission events leading to outbreaks in humans. Here we examine the disease potential of a SARS-like virus, SHC014-CoV, which is currently circulating in Chinese horseshoe bat populations. Using the SARS-CoV reverse genetics system, we generated and characterized a chimeric virus expressing the spike of bat coronavirus SHC014 in a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV backbone. The results indicate that group 2b viruses encoding the SHC014 spike in a wild-type backbone can efficiently use multiple orthologs of the SARS receptor human angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2), replicate efficiently in primary human airway cells and achieve in vitro titers equivalent to epidemic strains of SARS-CoV. Additionally, in vivo experiments demonstrate replication of the chimeric virus in mouse lung with notable pathogenesis. Evaluation of available SARS-based immune-therapeutic and prophylactic modalities revealed poor efficacy; both monoclonal antibody and vaccine approaches failed to neutralize and protect from infection with CoVs using the novel spike protein. On the basis of these findings, we synthetically re-derived an infectious full-length SHC014 recombinant virus and demonstrate robust viral replication both in vitro and in vivo. Our work suggests a potential risk of SARS-CoV re-emergence from viruses currently circulating in bat populations.

There are still questions about how SARS -CoV-2 initially took hold, such as precisely how and where it jumped from an animal, presumably a bat, to a human, and what other species might have served as intermediaries in the chain of transmission. Chinese officials also gave misleading accounts of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, and these reports served to underplay how common human-to-human transmission was. But those real failures have been exploited by President Trump ( ) , who regularly mentions them as a way to distract from his own failings. The United States is not alone in this regard: anger at China is rising in India ( ) (where the country’s Muslim minority has also been scapegoated for the virus’s spread). But it is fair to say that the center of super-spreaders in what has been an epidemic of attacks on Asian-Americans has been Washington.

Most patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections have reportedly had mild to severe respiratory illness with symptoms such as fever, cough and shortness of breath, which might appear 2–14 d after exposure. However, there are other patients who are diagnosed by a positive RT–PCR test but are either asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic 2 ( #ref-CR2 ) , 3 ( #ref-CR3 ) , 4 ( #ref-CR4 ) , 5 ( #ref-CR5 ) , 6 ( ). Increasing evidence has shown that asymptomatic individuals can spread the virus efficiently, and the emergence of these silent spreaders of SARS-CoV-2 has caused difficulties in the control of the epidemic 2 ( ) , 5 ( ). However, our understanding of the clinical features and immune responses of asymptomatic individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection is limited. Here we describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics, virus levels and immune responses in 37 asymptomatic individuals.

At the moment, the virus is tearing through a world of immunologically naive people, and that vulnerability is likely to swamp any seasonal variations. After all, the new virus is transmitting readily in countries like Singapore (which is in the tropics) and Australia (which is still in summer). And one recent modeling study ( ) concluded that “SARS-CoV-2 can proliferate at any time of year.” “I don’t have an immense amount of confidence that the weather is going to have the effect that people hope it will,” Gralinski says. “It may knock things down a little, but there’s so much person-to-person transmission going on that it may take more than that.” Unless people can slow the spread of the virus by sticking to physical-distancing recommendations, the summer alone won’t save us.

In addition, the receptor binding domains (RBD) of the spike protein (S) from SARS-CoV, bat SARSr-CoVs Rp3, WIV1, and SHC014 were produced in mammalian cells (Ge et al. 2013 ( ) ; Yang et al. 2016 ( ) ).

Increased news coverage and awareness of the virus in the general population have likely already prompted increased rates of seeking medical care for respiratory symptoms. In addition, awareness among health care providers and public health officials and the availability of viral identification assays suggest that capacity for identifying previously missed infections has increased. Further, general population and government response efforts have increased the use of face masks, restricted travel, delayed school reopening, and isolated suspected persons, all of which could additionally slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

A new study ( ) shows that people who are infected with milder human coronaviruses release fewer viral particles when they wear surgical masks. “I’ve been slightly dismissive of masks, but I was looking at them in the wrong way,” Harvard’s Bill Hanage told me. “You’re not wearing them to stop yourself getting infected, but to stop someone else getting infected.” This might be especially important for SARS-CoV-2, which can spread without immediately causing symptoms. If people are infectious before they fall sick, then everyone should wear face masks “when going out in public, in one additional societal effort to slow the spread of the virus down,” says Thomas Inglesby of the John Hopkins Center for Health Security.

Given the limited testing to date, some deaths and probably the vast majority of infections due to SARS-CoV-2 are being missed. We don’t know if we are failing to capture infections by a factor of three or 300. Three months after the outbreak emerged, most countries, including the U.S., lack the ability to test a large number of people and no countries have reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in a representative random sample of the general population.

In Italy, where 61 doctors have already died from Covid (a number that will grow past 100 in the next couple of weeks), health care workers believe that they themselves expedited the spread of the virus.

In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and death.

But now, the viral pneumonia coincides with the peak domestic travel season for Chinese New Year across China,” Mr Ho said during the briefing, “That huge passenger traffic means the disease could be spread to each of the Chinese provinces.”

While there is no good evidence to support asymptomatic transmission, we know that infectious viruses can be found without symptoms, for other viruses. It probably isn’t a major transmission route, though. So, unless we’re seeing something very different with this new coronavirus, people with coughs and sneezes and runny noses are more likely to be the major avenue for spread. If we do have milder disease due to the coronavirus – I expect we do – that will definitely make it harder to contain.

Meanwhile, the medical sector will carry out measures to look after the patients and improve its public health facilities. Once the immune system responds to the virus, or a vaccine for the new strain has been produced, the outbreak will end. All sectors, particularly the public, must cooperate to slow down its spread.

Today, nurses, physicians, and first responders exposed to known cases of COVID-19, some of whom have developed disease, are being quarantined, which threatens to collapse the health care system. It is anticipated that convalescent serum will prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in those to whom it is administered. If this is established, individuals who receive convalescent sera may be able to avoid a period of quarantine. This could allow them to continue their critical function as health care providers. Convalescent sera could also be used to prevent disease among family members caring for COVID-19 patients at home. Clearly, the use of convalescent serum would be a stopgap measure that could be used in the midst of the current epidemic. However, even local deployment will entail considerable coordination between different entities, such as infectious disease specialists, hematologists, blood banking specialists, and hospital administrators. Hence, as we are in the midst of a worldwide pandemic, we recommend that institutions consider the emergency use of convalescent sera and begin preparations as soon as possible. Time is of the essence.

Then you help them quarantine for two weeks—almost everyone who becomes sick will show symptoms within 14 days—so they do not accidentally spread the virus any further. The goal is to stop the chain of transmission, says Emily Gurley, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, who has created a free online course ( ) to train contact tracers.
