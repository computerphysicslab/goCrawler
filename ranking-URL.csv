This is concordant with recent clinical observations which show that COVID-19 exhibits a reduced interferon response in comparison to other respiratory viruses such as influenza and SARS.

Studies now consistently ( ) indicate that infectivity starts before symptoms do ( ) , that it peaks right around the day that they start, and that it declines substantially by five days or so. This is the pattern we see in influenza. But it’s the opposite of the pattern we saw with the coronavirus that caused China’s SARS outbreak eighteen years ago. That virus had a low risk of transmission until after five days from the onset of symptoms, which made it easier to identify and isolate cases before others got infected. No large-scale lockdown was necessary. It seems that there are also plenty of people who are infected by the virus that causes COVID -19 who never become symptomatic, especially children. So far, studies of transmission networks have not revealed such silent carriers to be a major source of spread. Nonetheless, patients who do not yet show symptoms, or have just begun to, are turning out to be important vectors of disease.

63.52	1092	[spread pandemic health disease masks virus know]	https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/nine-important-things-weve-learned-about-the-coronavirus-pandemic-so-far/	*Misinformation kills.* The president of the United States, other politicians, anti-vaccine activists ( ) , and members of the right-wing media, to their everlasting shame, have used the pandemic to stoke racism, spread misinformation and amplify conspiracy theories. Their followers have threatened health officials, including Tony Fauci and his family ( ) ; refused to wear masks; refused to cooperate with contact tracers ( ) ; and rejected proven basic public health advice about social distancing. Representative Louie Gohmert, who refused to wear a mask in the Capitol and reportedly discouraged his staff and interns ( ) from wearing masks, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 ( ) and is being treated with hydroxychloroquine ( ) , a drug that Trump has endorsed but that has failed in clinical trials ( ). Trump supporter Herman Cain died of COVID-19 ( ) on July 30, weeks after attending a rally in Tulsa without a mask. Calls to poison-control centers spiked ( ) after Trump speculated that injecting or ingesting disinfectants could protect against the coronavirus. Early evidence suggests people who watched Fox News were more likely to downplay the pandemic ( ) , worsening the spread ( ). The most important public health measure during a pandemic of a disease with no cure or vaccine—as many countries around the world that have controlled the virus have shown—is to help experts share clear, trustworthy, accurate, actionable information ( ) based on the best evidence. Spreading lies has spread this disease.

The health, social, and economic impact of this disease is unprecedented in our life-time. The COVID-19 pandemic has collapsed health care systems and led to an overwhelming pressure on Intensive Care Units (ICUs), since many patients developed profound hypoxemia and extensive pulmonary infiltrates requiring intubation and ventilatory support [ 2 ( ) ].

FluMist, for example, contains weakened flu viruses, and a handful of research groups ( ) are looking into the strategy for COVID-19. But live virus vaccines are riskier because, well, the virus is live. “We don’t want to be spraying coronavirus up people’s noses until [we] are absolutely sure that it’s actually a virus that can’t spread from person to person and that it can’t make somebody sick,” says Kathleen Neuzil ( ) , the director of the University of Maryland’s Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health. “It will just take time.”

A COVID-19 vaccine may prove to be more like the vaccines that protect against influenza: a critical public health tool that reduces the risk of contracting the disease, experiencing its most severe symptoms, and dying from it, but that does not completely prevent the spread of the virus. Nevertheless, given the potential of vaccines to end or contain the most deadly pandemic in a century, world leaders as varied as French President Emmanuel Macron, Chinese President Xi Jinping, and UN Secretary-General António Guterres have referred ( ) to them as global public goods—a resource to be made available to all, with the use of a vaccine in one country not interfering with its use in another.

For example, during the response to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 ( ) , the country prioritized population health over concerns for the economic impact of its response. Officials deployed a multi-sector response incorporating military, public security services and grassroot organizations while ensuring that transparent risk communication and effective community mobilization were emphasized throughout the outbreak. These lessons were certainly pulled into its current strategy. The country has also faced other outbreaks ( ) from which it drew similar lessons including Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, avian influenza, measles and dengue. Partners such as Gavi and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( ) have also invested in the country’s health system capacities long-term.

This novel corona virus SARS-CoV-2 has a specific tropism for the low respiratory airways, but causes severe pneumonia in a low percentage of patients. However, the rapid spread of the infection during this pandemic is causing the need to hospitalize a high number of patients. Pneumonia in COVID-19 has peculiar features and can be studied by lung ultrasound in the early approach to suspected patients. The sonographic signs are non-specific when considered alone, but observation of some aspects of vertical artifacts can enhance the diagnostic power of the ultrasound examination. Also, the combination of sonographic signs in patterns and their correlation with blood exams in different phenotypes of the disease may allow for a reliable characterization and be of help in triaging and admitting patients.

Nasal respiratory epithelial cells and olfactory epithelial support cells have been shown to express high levels of ACE2 proteins used by the SARS-Cov2 virus, which causes the COVID-19 syndrome, to infect cells [ 2 ( ) ]. Previously described human strains of coronavirus have also been demonstrated to invade the central nervous system and propagate from within the olfactory bulb [ 3 ( ) ]. It is therefore perhaps no surprise that alterations in sense of smell would be reported by patients with COVID-19.

This virus genetically is very similar to a bat coronavirus in the subgenus Sarbecovirus [ 2 ( ) ]. The WHO named the disease as COVID-19 [ 3 ( ) ] and it spread all over the world rapidly less than 3 month s. corona viruses can be classified into four genera (α, β, γ, and δ) and they are detected in a very wide selection of animal species, including humans [ 4 ( ) ]. The virus that causes the COVID-19 infection belongs to the β coronaviruses family. Since the beginning of the twenty-first century, three coronaviruses crossed the species barrier and causes deadly pneumonia in humans: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [ 5 ( ) ], Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus [ 6 ( ) ], and SARS-CoV-2 [ 7 ( ) ]. Unlike previous coronaviruses that caused large-scale epidemics such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), the transmission rate for COVID-19 is much higher [ 8 ( ) ]. Due to the high rate of contagious and highly nonspecific symptoms of this disease such as respiratory symptoms, cough, dyspnea, fever, and viral pneumonia [ 7 ( ) ], the establishment of precise and fast diagnostic tests are urgently required to verify suspected cases, screen patients, and conduct virus surveillance.

And in the U.S., the testing fiasco has only amplified that uncertainty. How many people have the new coronavirus? How many people will become infected and never know? How likely are they to spread it? What role do children play? What is the actual death rate? These are crucial data, and we simply don’t have reliable estimates right now ( ). In addition, how societies behave feeds back into the epidemic’s severity, adding another layer of uncertainty. The way the virus behaves in China or Italy will be different from how it behaves here, depending on what we do. The only thing we know for sure is that things continue to change rapidly, which also means that in these circumstances, anyone claiming certainty is suspect.

Here we examine the disease potential of a SARS-like virus, SHC014-CoV, which is currently circulating in Chinese horseshoe bat populations. Using the SARS-CoV reverse genetics system, we generated and characterized a chimeric virus expressing the spike of bat coronavirus SHC014 in a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV backbone. The results indicate that group 2b viruses encoding the SHC014 spike in a wild-type backbone can efficiently use multiple orthologs of the SARS receptor human angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2), replicate efficiently in primary human airway cells and achieve in vitro titers equivalent to epidemic strains of SARS-CoV. Additionally, in vivo experiments demonstrate replication of the chimeric virus in mouse lung with notable pathogenesis. Evaluation of available SARS-based immune-therapeutic and prophylactic modalities revealed poor efficacy; both monoclonal antibody and vaccine approaches failed to neutralize and protect from infection with CoVs using the novel spike protein. On the basis of these findings, we synthetically re-derived an infectious full-length SHC014 recombinant virus and demonstrate robust viral replication both in vitro and in vivo. Our work suggests a potential risk of SARS-CoV re-emergence from viruses currently circulating in bat populations.

There are still questions about how SARS -CoV-2 initially took hold, such as precisely how and where it jumped from an animal, presumably a bat, to a human, and what other species might have served as intermediaries in the chain of transmission. Chinese officials also gave misleading accounts of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, and these reports served to underplay how common human-to-human transmission was. But those real failures have been exploited by President Trump ( ) , who regularly mentions them as a way to distract from his own failings. The United States is not alone in this regard: anger at China is rising in India ( ) (where the country’s Muslim minority has also been scapegoated for the virus’s spread). But it is fair to say that the center of super-spreaders in what has been an epidemic of attacks on Asian-Americans has been Washington.

Most patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections have reportedly had mild to severe respiratory illness with symptoms such as fever, cough and shortness of breath, which might appear 2–14 d after exposure. However, there are other patients who are diagnosed by a positive RT–PCR test but are either asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic 2 ( #ref-CR2 ) , 3 ( #ref-CR3 ) , 4 ( #ref-CR4 ) , 5 ( #ref-CR5 ) , 6 ( ). Increasing evidence has shown that asymptomatic individuals can spread the virus efficiently, and the emergence of these silent spreaders of SARS-CoV-2 has caused difficulties in the control of the epidemic 2 ( ) , 5 ( ). However, our understanding of the clinical features and immune responses of asymptomatic individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection is limited. Here we describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics, virus levels and immune responses in 37 asymptomatic individuals.

At the moment, the virus is tearing through a world of immunologically naive people, and that vulnerability is likely to swamp any seasonal variations. After all, the new virus is transmitting readily in countries like Singapore (which is in the tropics) and Australia (which is still in summer). And one recent modeling study ( ) concluded that “SARS-CoV-2 can proliferate at any time of year.” “I don’t have an immense amount of confidence that the weather is going to have the effect that people hope it will,” Gralinski says. “It may knock things down a little, but there’s so much person-to-person transmission going on that it may take more than that.” Unless people can slow the spread of the virus by sticking to physical-distancing recommendations, the summer alone won’t save us.

In addition, the receptor binding domains (RBD) of the spike protein (S) from SARS-CoV, bat SARSr-CoVs Rp3, WIV1, and SHC014 were produced in mammalian cells (Ge et al. 2013 ( ) ; Yang et al. 2016 ( ) ).

Increased news coverage and awareness of the virus in the general population have likely already prompted increased rates of seeking medical care for respiratory symptoms. In addition, awareness among health care providers and public health officials and the availability of viral identification assays suggest that capacity for identifying previously missed infections has increased. Further, general population and government response efforts have increased the use of face masks, restricted travel, delayed school reopening, and isolated suspected persons, all of which could additionally slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

A new study ( ) shows that people who are infected with milder human coronaviruses release fewer viral particles when they wear surgical masks. “I’ve been slightly dismissive of masks, but I was looking at them in the wrong way,” Harvard’s Bill Hanage told me. “You’re not wearing them to stop yourself getting infected, but to stop someone else getting infected.” This might be especially important for SARS-CoV-2, which can spread without immediately causing symptoms. If people are infectious before they fall sick, then everyone should wear face masks “when going out in public, in one additional societal effort to slow the spread of the virus down,” says Thomas Inglesby of the John Hopkins Center for Health Security.

Given the limited testing to date, some deaths and probably the vast majority of infections due to SARS-CoV-2 are being missed. We don’t know if we are failing to capture infections by a factor of three or 300. Three months after the outbreak emerged, most countries, including the U.S., lack the ability to test a large number of people and no countries have reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in a representative random sample of the general population.

In Italy, where 61 doctors have already died from Covid (a number that will grow past 100 in the next couple of weeks), health care workers believe that they themselves expedited the spread of the virus.

While there is no good evidence to support asymptomatic transmission, we know that infectious viruses can be found without symptoms, for other viruses. It probably isn’t a major transmission route, though. So, unless we’re seeing something very different with this new coronavirus, people with coughs and sneezes and runny noses are more likely to be the major avenue for spread. If we do have milder disease due to the coronavirus – I expect we do – that will definitely make it harder to contain.

Today, nurses, physicians, and first responders exposed to known cases of COVID-19, some of whom have developed disease, are being quarantined, which threatens to collapse the health care system. It is anticipated that convalescent serum will prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in those to whom it is administered. If this is established, individuals who receive convalescent sera may be able to avoid a period of quarantine. This could allow them to continue their critical function as health care providers. Convalescent sera could also be used to prevent disease among family members caring for COVID-19 patients at home. Clearly, the use of convalescent serum would be a stopgap measure that could be used in the midst of the current epidemic. However, even local deployment will entail considerable coordination between different entities, such as infectious disease specialists, hematologists, blood banking specialists, and hospital administrators. Hence, as we are in the midst of a worldwide pandemic, we recommend that institutions consider the emergency use of convalescent sera and begin preparations as soon as possible. Time is of the essence.

Then you help them quarantine for two weeks—almost everyone who becomes sick will show symptoms within 14 days—so they do not accidentally spread the virus any further. The goal is to stop the chain of transmission, says Emily Gurley, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, who has created a free online course ( ) to train contact tracers.

Several options can be envisaged to control or prevent emerging infections of 2019-nCoV, including vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, oligonucleotide-based therapies, peptides, interferon therapies and small-molecule drugs. However, new interventions are likely to require months to years to develop. Given the urgency of the 2019-nCoV outbreak, we focus here on the potential to repurpose existing antiviral agents approved or in development for treating infections caused by HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and influenza 1 ( #ref-CR1 ) , based on therapeutic experience with two other infections caused by human coronaviruses: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).

The initial cases were linked to exposures in a seafood market in Wuhan. 1 ( ) As of January 27, 2020, the Chinese authorities reported 2835 confirmed cases in mainland China, including 81 deaths. Additionally, 19 confirmed cases were identified in Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, and 39 imported cases were identified in Thailand, Japan, South Korea, United States, Vietnam, Singapore, Nepal, France, Australia and Canada. The pathogen was soon identified as a novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which is closely related to sever acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV). 2 ( ) Currently, there is no specific treatment against the new virus. Therefore, identifying effective antiviral agents to combat the disease is urgently needed.

Can transmission take place before the onset of symptoms? (Measles, one of the most contagious diseases on Earth, is infectious two to four days beforehand.)

Do symptomatic people become less contagious over time, like SARS, or is it like Ebola, which becomes increasingly contagious as the disease progresses? These are all unanswered questions.

46.07	3693	[ncov neonates infection symptoms chest delivery showed]	http://tp.amegroups.com/article/view/35919/28274	In December 2019, a novel coronavirus labelled 2019-nCoV, which is believed to have originated in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei province, began spreading rapidly across China. The virus is transmitted mainly via respiratory droplets contact, and human-to-human transmission and family clustering have been reported ( 1 ( #B1 ) , 2 ( #B2 ) ). As of 7:00 AM on February 5, 2020, according to data released by the National Health Commission of China, 23,696 cases of the virus were confirmed in China, and other countries, including Japan, Thailand, Singapore, Republic of Korea, the United States, and Australia have also reported cases. Human populations are generally susceptible to 2019-nCoV, and it bears a particularly high risk for pregnant women and children because they are in a special state of immune suppression. In fact, the youngest patient confirmed with 2019-nCoV infection was only 1 month old. As the biological characteristics of 2019-nCoV require further investigation, it is unclear whether mother-to-infant transmission is possible, and thus there is no sufficient evidence for the prevention and control of neonatal infections. In this article, we retrospectively analyzed the clinical features and outcomes of 10 neonates (including 2 twins) born to 9 mothers with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection in 5 hospitals in Hubei from January 20 to February 5, 2020, in an attempt to inform the management of neonates born during the 2019-nCoV outbreak.

The symptoms, Mannan adds, also suggest that the virus has the ability to invade the central nervous system, which could cause neurological damage and possibly play a role in patients dying from COVID-19.

51.20	308	[covid binding protease main flavonol flavonoids virus]	https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2020/RA/D0RA03582C	In December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) commenced in Wuhan, China and affected around 210 countries and territories in a matter of weeks. It has a phylogenetic similarity to SARS-CoV and it was named coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and caused severe acute respiratory syndrome that could lead to death. One of the promising therapeutic strategies for virus infection is the search for enzyme inhibitors among natural compounds using molecular docking in order to obtain products with minimal side effects. COVID-19 virus main protease plays a vital role in mediating viral transcription and replication, introducing it as an attractive antiviral agent target. Metabolic profiling of the aqueous extract of Salvadora persica L. (Salvadoraceae) aerial parts dereplicated eleven known flavonol glycosides using LC-HRESIMS. All the annotated flavonoids exhibited significant binding stability at the N3 binding site to different degrees, except isorhamnetin-3- O -β- D -glucopyranoside, when compared with the currently used COVID-19 main protease inhibitor, darunavir. Structural similarity between the identified flavonoids enabled the study of the relationship between their structure and interactions with the receptor in the N3 binding site of the COVID-19 main protease. The results indicate that the basic flavonol nucleus possesses activity itself. Moreover, the presence of a rutinose moiety at the 3 position of ring C and absence of an O -methyl group in ring B of the flavonol structure could increase the binding stability. This study provides a scientific basis for the health benefits of the regular use of S. persica as it leaches bioactive flavonoids in the aqueous saliva.

Methods　Fifty-three ARDS patients admitted to ICU of Songjiang District Center Hospital of Shanghai from Dec. 2011 to Jun. 2013 were randomly divided into two groups. Group A (n=29) received conventional therapy, and group B (n=24) was given glucocorticoid inhalation treatment (budesonide, 2 mg, h, for 12 days) on the basis of the conventional therapy. The oxygenation index, time of extubation, changes in pulmonary fibrosis index, including collagen Ⅰ(Co Ⅰ), Ⅲ procollagen peptide (PⅢP) and transforming growth factor (TGF-β1) were compared between the two groups, and the incidence of common adverse reactions were analyzed. Results　The oxygenation index of patients in group B was significantly improved on the 15th day compared with group A (P<0.05). There was a significant difference in the level of Co I, PⅢP and TGF-β1 between two groups as measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (P<0.05). The hormone therapy did not increase adverse effects (P>0.05). Conclusion　A small dose of glucocorticoids introduced by inhalation can improve the oxygenation index and pulmonary fibrosis level without increasing common adverse reactions, suggesting that the inhalation of corticosteroid may be a clinically safe and effective way in patients with ARDS.

Time between symptom onset, NAAT testing, and sample collection is not known for all samples. Both SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies are present in all positive samples used. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) detected the presence of IgG and IgM antibodies at their laboratory using their SARS-CoV-2 spike enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests. (See Serology Testing for COVID-19 ( ) , which notes “CDC’s serologic test is designed and validated for broad-based surveillance and research that will give us information needed to guide the response to the pandemic and protect the public’s health. The test is not currently designed to test individuals who want to know if they have been previously infected with COVID-19.”) The presence of antibodies was confirmed at FNLCR using CDC’s developed ELISAs (Pan-Ig, IgG, and IgM) as well as an IgG Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) ELISA developed by the Krammer Laboratory at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. (An implementation of this test, the COVID-19 ELISA IgG Antibody Test, has been granted an EUA authorization by FDA for use at the Mount Sinai Laboratory (MSL), Center for Clinical Laboratories, a division of the Department of Pathology, Molecular, and Cell-Based Medicine, New York, NY. See this EUA Summary ( ).) The positive samples selected may not reflect the distribution of antibody levels in patient populations that would be evaluated by such a test. Because all samples are positive for both IgM and IgG, this evaluation cannot verify that tests intended to detect IgM and IgG antibodies separately detect these antibodies independently.

48.02	1404	[flu coronavirus crisis warzel property covid deaths]	https://www.hoover.org/research/playing-politics-coronavirus	Why has there been such a dramatic mismatch in the responses to ordinary flu and the coronavirus? Medical and epidemiological experts say that the capacity of COVID-19 to spread could generate huge numbers of deaths and illnesses worldwide. It is presently estimated that COVID-19 has a global mortality rate in the ballpark ( ) of 3 percent, being roughly an order of magnitude more fatal than traditional influenza ( ). COVID-19 may also be more contagious ( ) than the flu: Preliminary studies suggest that one infected with the coronavirus will infect somewhere between 2 and 3 others, whereas one infected with the flu will spread it, on average, only to 1.3 others.  Even still, we are a long way from the Spanish flu pandemic ( ) of 1918, which resulted in perhaps 500 million infections and between 50 and 100 million deaths worldwide, including some 675,000 Americans. The level of medical and institutional sophistication today makes it exceedingly unlikely that these results will be replicated with COVID-19.

In Iceland, these measures have focused on testing, contact tracing of infections, social distancing, public efforts to increase basic awareness of hand sanitation, voluntary self-quarantine measures (currently about 5 448 individuals), and strict measures at healthcare institutions, nursing homes and the likes. Of the 473 cases identified 13 are individuals over age 70, considered to be the most at-risk group.

Part of a Brazilian study on the effectiveness of chloroquine was stopped after some of its 81 subjects developed dangerous heart irregularities. Hydroxychloroquine, a derivative of chloroquine with similar pharmacological properties, also appears to be dangerous and lack efficacy. A study of 368 coronavirus patients published online on Tuesday found that those given hydroxychloroquine experienced an increased risk of death. Revised treatment guidelines issued the same day by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases recommend that doctors only prescribe hydroxychloroquine in combination with the antibiotic azithromycin in clinical trials, and that if doctors prescribe hydroxychloroquine, they should monitor patients for adverse effects. Both Trump and Fox News have backed away from their promotion of the drug. The original article continues below.

For example, they could recommend trusted, accessible locations for new testing sites and advise on how to diversify the pool of contact tracers ( ) , who will be crucial to tamping down the spread of infection in reopened communities. They could also collaborate with government leaders to ensure that all people who are infected with coronavirus (or exposed to someone infected) have a safe, secure, and acceptable place to isolate or quarantine for 14 days. Key partners could include community health centers, small business associations, community organizing groups, and workers’ rights organizations, among others. Ultimately, state and local leaders should measure the success of their response based not only on total death counts and aggregate economic impacts but also on the health and social outcomes of the most marginalized.

CDC guidance for the care of patients with COVID-19 therefore recommends that N95 respirators be worn by staff present during these procedures. But the lack of evidence that the virus aerosolizes in any other situation is one reason why the CDC tells us that surgical (“droplet”) masks can be worn during the routine care of people with COVID-19 infection.

Alongside plenty of anecdotal evidence, the main source for the Times piece is a report of sorts ( ) —a letter, really—published by the British Rhinological Society and a group called Ear, Nose, and Throat U.K. arguing that a loss of sense of smell is “a marker of COVID-19 infection.” The letter goes on to explain that anosmia is not uncommon after viral infections, and that in fact “viruses that give rise to the common cold are well known to cause post-infectious loss.” The percentage of people who when infected by coronaviruses like the common cold and COVID-19 then lose their sense of smell is unclear—I checked with a few experts who just said it was a common occurrence, but they couldn’t put a number on it. But looking at it from the other side, various surveys ( ) indicate that among folks experiencing anosmia, viruses are thought to be responsible for about a quarter of cases.

With each infected person expected to infect 2 or 3 additional people, 2 as well as remaining uncertainty regarding the clinical spectrum of disease, 3 COVID-19 threatens to overwhelm the US healthcare system within the coming months. Even currently, before COVID-19 infection rates reach high-risk levels in the United States, patients with mild respiratory symptoms are seeking COVID-19 confirmatory testing and clinical reassurance from providers, and employers are developing response plans that may include requiring sick employees to seek healthcare provider release before returning to work. Because of this mounting public urgency and currently uncontained spread, healthcare providers are already experiencing and must prepare for additional increased volumes of both sick and worried-well patients that could strain hospital care units and medical equipment supply chains. Healthcare provider disaster response policies and procedures should be revisited to incorporate telemedicine systems to address some of the unique challenges posed by infectious disease outbreaks such as COVID-19.

Combination therapies adopted by other clinical trials may solve the shortcomings of single-drug therapies with slightly better efficacy, but the higher risk of adverse effects is inevitable.

Interstitial pneumonia and ILD are manifestations of some viral infections in a subgroup of patients in the short term and may persist for months or years in another subgroup of patients who survive following severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) associated with coronavirus,” said Ganesh Raghu, MD, professor of medicine and adjunct professor of laboratory medicine at the University of Washington (UW) and director of the Center for Interstitial Lung Disease at UW Medicine. “Certain pathobiological features of COVID-19 are similar to features of interstitial pneumonia and acute exacerbations of fibrotic lung diseases. Therapeutic strategies targeting pathways of immune dysregulation, innate immunity, inflammation and fibrosis are appropriate to consider as potential treatments of COVID-19 and fibrotic ILD in the context of clinical trials.”

The health of these patients often rapidly deteriorates due to the unchecked immune response to the virus leading to hyperinflammation and cytokine storm,” said Jeffrey Cleland, Ph.D., Chairman, CEO & President at Ashvattha Therapeutics and Executive Chairman of Orpheris. “The hydroxyl dendrimer component of OP-101 enables targeting to reactive macrophages, which are responsible for hyperinflammation, lung injury, and multi-organ failure caused by COVID-19. OP-101 normalizes reactive macrophages, shuts down the cytokine cascade and reduces oxidative stress to arrest hyperinflammation. We look forward to this clinical evaluation of OP-101, as there are currently no FDA approved treatment options to treat hyperinflammation in severe COVID-19 patients.”

This new disease was unknown before the outbreak was first discovered in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. Older people and those with underlying medical problems such as high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness, but even young, previously healthy people can suffer severe disease and complications such as ARDS. Data are still emerging, but recently published case series suggest mortality rates among COVID-19 patients who develop ARDS may be 50% to 70%, or perhaps even higher in some environments.

To recap, based on the observation of 80 patients, Chinese doctors in Wuhan noted that no patients with lupus erythematosis became ill with COVID-19 and hypothesized that the chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine that they were taking might be the reason. (These drugs are also mildly immunosuppressive, hence their use to treat autoimmune diseases.) Of course, during a pandemic, it is people who are immunosuppressed are the very people who most rigorously obey orders to practice social distancing and self-quarantine and thereby protect themselves from infection. Be that as it may, the Chinese doctors started using the antimalarial drugs, and anecdotal evidence of success was reported, leading to randomized clinical trials that were announced by the Chinese government to have been “promising.” (None have been published yet, other than a study published as a preprint last week with so many issues that it shows, in essence, nothing ( ).) None of this stopped China from incorporating these drugs into its recommended regimen. The World Health Organization followed suit, as did several countries, and thus was born a new de facto standard of care for COVID-19 based on, in essence, no evidence other than some in vitro evidence that the drugs inhibit replication of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, anecdotes, and incredibly weak clinical trial evidence.

A coronavirus is a family of viruses so named because they are spherical, with spike proteins protruding around their circumference, resembling the sun’s corona. As it happens, every other virus family that infects animal cells shares these physical corona-like characteristics (whereas viruses that infect bacteria look more like mean little alien spiders), and a more defining feature of coronaviruses is the large, single chromosomal RNA genome. This particular coronavirus is called SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) and the disease it causes is COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). SARS-CoV-2 is named because, naturally, it’s the third coronavirus outbreak to cause similar symptoms, after the SARS and MERS (Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome) outbreaks of 2002 and 2012 respectively. So to summarise, the virus family is named after a shape it shares with all other animal viruses, the disease is named after the virus and the virus is named after the disease. SARS-CoV-2 is the third coronavirus outbreak that causes SARS, and we never name disease outbreaks after their location of origin unless we really, really feel like it. At a time when it’s never been more important to listen to the scientific community, one might be forgiven for asking what exactly they’re doing to make their message easy to understand.

The expansion phase coincided with the Lunar New Year holiday period during which schools were closed, and schools remained closed thereafter. Additionally, cases in children were likely missed, as those with mild – or absent – symptoms were unlikely to receive testing.

Initial estimates of the early dynamics of the outbreak in Wuhan, China, suggested a doubling time of the number of infected persons of 6–7 days and a basic reproductive number (R 0 ) of 2.2–2.7. We collected extensive individual case reports across China and estimated key epidemiologic parameters, including the incubation period (4.2 days). We then designed 2 mathematical modeling approaches to infer the outbreak dynamics in Wuhan by using high-resolution domestic travel and infection data. Results show that the doubling time early in the epidemic in Wuhan was 2.3–3.3 days. Assuming a serial interval of 6–9 days, we calculated a median R 0 value of 5.7 (95% CI 3.8–8.9). We further show that active surveillance, contact tracing, quarantine, and early strong social distancing efforts are needed to stop transmission of the virus.

The failure to understand the difference between coronavirus strains has led to a proliferation of conspiracy theories, including one in which a patent on a coronavirus strain for a vaccine (as I understand it) has led to arguments that this outbreak was caused by a bioweapon. Such conspiracy theories -as I discuss at length on this blog and in my work- ( ) appear with every epidemic. Misleading articles have claimed that the actually vastly higher ( ) than has been publicly reported. Although Bill Gates is often a prominent figure in these conspiracy theories, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has given $10 million dollars to help fight the virus.

The role of Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, China, in spreading 2019-nCoV remains murky, though such sequencing, combined with sampling the market’s environment for the presence of the virus, is clarifying that it indeed had an important early role in amplifying the outbreak. The viral sequences, most researchers say, also knock down the idea the pathogen came from a virology institute in Wuhan.

The causative pathogen was identified as a novel coronavirus ( 1 ( #ref-1 ) – 16 ( #ref-16 ) ) and named severe acute respiratory syndrome–coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on the basis of a phylogenetic analysis of related coronaviruses by the Coronaviridae Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses ( 17 ( #ref-17 ) ). Subsequently, the disease caused by this virus was designated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization (WHO). Despite major efforts to control the COVID-19 outbreak, the disease is still spreading. As of 11 March 2020, SARS-CoV-2 infections have been reported in more than 100 countries, and 118,326 human cases have been confirmed, with 4292 fatalities ( 18 ( #ref-18 ) ). WHO has now officially declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
53.34	1549	[patients cov sars covid infection cardiovascular symptoms]	https://www.nature.com/articles/s41569-020-0360-5	In December 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus occurred in Wuhan, Hubei province, and has spread rapidly throughout China, with an ongoing risk of a pandemic 1 ( ). After virus identification and isolation, the pathogen for this pneumonia was originally called 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) 2 ( ) but has subsequently been officially named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the WHO. On 30 January 2020, the WHO declared the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Compared with the SARS-CoV that caused an outbreak of SARS in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 has a stronger transmission capacity. The rapid increase in confirmed cases makes the prevention and control of COVID-19 extremely serious. Although the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are dominated by respiratory symptoms, some patients have severe cardiovascular damage 3 ( ). In addition, some patients with underlying cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) might have an increased risk of death 3 ( ). Therefore, understanding the damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 to the cardiovascular system and the underlying mechanisms is of the greatest importance, so that treatment of these patients can be timely and effective and mortality reduced.

The policy rewarded couples for having a single child with better houses, free education and healthcare, and cash bonuses. The birth rate dropped from 2.1 to about 1.4 children per woman. The policy was met with resistance especially in the rural areas as women avoided giving birth in hospitals and families lied in population censuses resulting in skewed data. The government ended the policy in 2016 after experts warned that the country was at risk of losing a generation to replace the aging population.

The disruptive effects from this pandemic are different than what nonprofits have faced in the past. Natural disasters are bound by geography and a recession is contained to the market, but a pandemic cuts across all sectors. Revenue loss is defined not by source of funding but tied to people gathering to receive or enjoy the services of our nonprofits. Organizations called to serve those who are hungry, are in need of shelter, or are in search of healthcare face exceptional challenges. They have to manage increases in demand amid constrained capacity, concerns for the health and safety of staff and clients, and availability of workers who don’t have the privilege of working remotely or who are unable to both work and care for children who are home because of school and day care closures.

Elderly and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions, such as heart or lung disease, and diabetes, appear to be at higher risk of developing serious illness. If symptoms develop such as fever, cough, and difficulty breathing, and you have been in close contact with a person known to have COVID-19 or have recently traveled from an area with ongoing spread of COVID-19, the CDC advises individuals to stay home and contact their health care provider. Recognizing persons who are at risk for COVID-19 is a critical component of identifying cases and preventing further transmission. Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) ( )

It arises from mutation of a virus an animal reservoir, and origins from laboratory sources has been ruled out ( ). It is related to the common cold virus and that causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS). Vaccines against these viruses are complex to develop, as illustrated by the fact we currently have no vaccine against the cold, SARS or MERS. The disease caused by SARs-CoV-2 is termed corona virus disease-19 (COVID-19) because the World Health Organization (WHO) was first notified of the localised surge in cases of pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan, China on 31 December 2019.

Doctor Favero shared with us an idea to fix the possible shortage of hospital C-PAP masks for sub-intensive therapy, which is emerging as a concrete problem linked to the spread of Covid-19: it’s the construction of an emergency ventilator mask, realized by adjusting a snorkeling mask already available on the market.

In December 2019 and continuing to spread in 2020 we have the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic which has infected 191,127 individuals *1* (confirmed cases) worldwide and has resulted in 7,807 deaths *1* as of March 18, 2020.

We’ve already heard racist terms such as “Chinese flu” and “Wuhan virus.” There also has been a reported rise in anti-Asian racism in the US ( ) and abroad ( ). And yet, there have only been a small number of explicit funds directly naming the concerns of racist violence and immediate economic impacts on the AAPI community. This is particularly challenging as AAPI nonprofits have been increasingly left out of targeted racial justice focused funding.

Some governors, mayors, education authorities and employers have led the way by enforcing social distancing, closing campuses and other places, and channeling resources to support the most vulnerable. And the civic fabric of some communities has fostered the responsibility and altruism of millions of ordinary citizens who have stayed home, lost income, kept their kids inside, self-quarantined, refrained from hoarding, supported each other, and even pooled medical supplies and other resources to bolster health workers. The coronavirus is this century’s most urgent challenge to humanity. Harnessing a new sense of solidarity, citizens of states and cities will rise to face the enormous challenges ahead such as climate change and transforming our era of historic inequality into one of economic inclusion.

It also results from poorer outcomes after acquiring COVID-19—such as resulting from less access to testing; higher presence of underlying health conditions like diabetes, hypertension, obesity and asthma; and receiving delayed or poorer medical care, perhaps because they lack health insurance or distrust health providers or they are simply receiving inferior care. The racial disparities in COVID-19 mortality—due to these compounding, elevated risks from our systems of housing, labor force, health care, and policy responses—are what is termed systemic racism.

The program, which taps into the Federal Government’s Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act ( ) , aims to jumpstart telemedicine programs across the country in an effort to drive efficiencies across the health care system, freeing up as much physical space in clinics and hospitals as possible so that valuable health care resources are directed to those most in need. This initiative comes on the heels of comments by Dr. Nancy Messonnier, the director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, who gave a full-throated endorsement of the sector, encouraging hospitals ( ) to look into expanding telehealth services to effectively offload some of their baseline demand.

Similarly, Ou and colleagues 3 show that cathepsin L inhibitor SID26681509 dramatically decreased SARS-CoV-2-S pseudovirions entry into cells, suggesting that cathepsin L is essential for priming of SARS-CoV-2 S protein in the lysosome. Indeed, this potential association has been recently proposed by Liu T et al. 1 We have previously shown that the first generation HIV protease inhibitor, saquinavir, blocks the activity of mouse cathepsin L (cathepsin V in humans) in macrophages. 4 Herein, we evaluated a possible inhibitory effect of several FDA-approved HIV protease inhibitors on the activity of cathepsin L.

Until vaccines are widely available, the only available infection prevention approaches are case isolation, contact tracing and quarantine, physical distancing, decontamination, and hygiene measures. To implement the right measures at the right time, it is of crucial importance to understand the routes and timings of transmission.

This would be sufficient to reduce R 0 from a value from 2.6 before the lockdown to 0.62 (0.37 - 0.89) during the lockdown, indicating that physical distancing interventions are effective in reducing the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and should lead to a substantial impact and decline in cases in the coming weeks. However, this projected decline in incidence will not occur immediately due to significant delays between infection, onset of symptomatic disease and hospitalisation, and reporting of these events. Panel A in Figure 1 compares the social contact matrix found in our current study to that in the POLYMOD study, and panel B shows our estimate of the current R 0 value.

Medley chairs a group of scientists who model the spread of infectious diseases and advise the government on pandemic responses. He says that the actual goal is the same as that of other countries: flatten the curve by staggering the onset of infections. As a consequence , the nation may achieve herd immunity; it’s a side effect, not an aim. Indeed, yesterday, U.K. Health Secretary Matt Hancock stated ( ) , “Herd immunity is not our goal or policy.” The government’s actual coronavirus action plan ( ) , available online, doesn’t mention herd immunity at all. “The messaging has been really confusing, and I think that was really unfortunate,” says Petra Klepac, who is also an infectious-disease modeler at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “It’s been a case of how not to communicate during an outbreak,” says Devi Sridhar ( ) , a public-health specialist at the University of Edinburgh.

Since the onset of the outbreak there, government officials with the Agriculture, Fisheries, and Conservation Department (AFCD) recommended that mammalian pets from households with persons hospitalized because of COVID-19 be cared for in quarantine and tested for infection with SARS-CoV-2. As of April 15, 30 dogs, 17 cats, and two hamsters had been held at the AFCD quarantine facility. However, only two dogs and one cat have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Infection was confirmed by detection and sequencing of viral RNA in upper respiratory tract samples and detection of neutralizing antibodies against the virus in serum. Virus also was isolated from one of the two infected dogs. None of the animals in quarantine, including the three positive pets, developed clinical signs of respiratory disease and all positive animals were released from quarantine after at least a 14-day stay and negative RT-PCR test results on samples collected over at least two consecutive days. On May 14, an article ( ) describing SARS-CoV-2 infection in the two Hong Kong dogs was published online in Nature.

Serology tests are blood-based, and can be used to determine whether individuals have been exposed to a particular pathogen by looking at antibodies, or proteins produced by the body in response to an infection. Serology tests can be helpful in determining whether someone was infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, regardless of whether they ever developed symptoms of the disease. Serology tests can better quantify the number of cases of COVID-19 in the population, including those that may be asymptomatic or have recovered.

Two of these high-risk types (HPV16 and HPV18) account for about 70% all cases of cervical cancer worldwide. Vaccines have been developed that help the immune system to recognize certain HPV types. Because cervical cancer can take several years to develop, regulatory bodies and international health agencies such as the World Health Organization (WHO) regard cervical lesions as the preferred outcome measure for HPV vaccine trials.

To preempt this potential danger, employers should ensure business continuity plans take into account and prepare for biological threats. SHRM recommends employers consider the following preventive measures: Actively encourage sick employees to stay home, send symptomatic employees home until they are able to return to work safely, and require employees returning from high-risk areas to telework during the incubation period. As with any widespread virus, bacterium or other biological threat, employers should take care to protect their workers and their future business operations. We will continue to monitor the COVID-19 outbreak closely, following guidance from the World Health Organization, the UAE National Emergency Crisis and Disasters Management Authority, India's national health agency, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

It is still unclear to what extent children, especially younger ones, are likely to get infected or transmit the infection to others compared to adults. However, where there is already widespread community transmission, as is the case in many areas in the U.S., there is clearly a risk of spread associated with reopening schools. This challenge may be more pronounced where testing and contact tracing capacity is limited. As such, the risk of re-opening schools needs to be considered carefully in light of the recognized benefits of in-person education.

One surprising aspect of this pandemic is that children appear to be infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19, far less frequently than adults and, when infected, typically have mild symptoms, 1 ( #ref-1 ) – 3 ( #ref-3 ) although emerging reports of a novel Kawasaki disease–like multisystem inflammatory syndrome necessitate continued surveillance in pediatric patients. 4 ( #ref-4 ) , 5 ( #ref-5 ) However, a major question remains unanswered: to what extent are children responsible for SARS-CoV-2 transmission? Resolving this issue is central to making informed public health decisions, ranging from how to safely re-open schools, child care facilities, and summer camps down to the precautions needed to obtain a throat culture in an uncooperative child. To date, few published data are available to help guide these decisions.

While matters of public health may be an opportunity for people to unite over shared challenges, historically we have experienced quite the opposite. Although viruses don’t care whether a person supports or opposes the administration in office while it infects, sickens, and kills, one only need to look back at the *Reagan administration’s shocking downplaying and mishandling of the AIDS crisis ( )* and note similar startling parallels of politicization with our current COVID-19 crisis. Compound this with the politics of an election year, and many health care nonprofits are navigating partisan politics in ways that don’t normally intersect with their life-saving advocacy work.

That can be especially challenging for people over 65 who often face additional challenges reaching the nearest hospital even as they face higher risk of extended hospitalization and death ( ) from COVID-19. In Idaho, Oregon, Colorado and New Mexico, more than 19,000 citizens over the age of 65 live in counties without hospital beds.

Yet, neoliberal policy-making has allowed health services to be chronically underfunded in the UK for over a decade. As a result, Britain has an already-low capacity to provide critical care (one of the lowest in Europe) that wouldn’t suffice ‘even with strict lockdown measures’ (Frey 2020; np). Ultimately, we are too late – healthcare would have to have been funded properly, and ethically, years prior to a pandemic to be sufficient. Playing into neoliberalism’s “blame game” – that in a free market if you’re poor, unemployed, and vulnerable that it’s ultimately your fault – means that governments place the ‘failure of the health system on the virus, rather than on bad governance’ (Frey 2020; np).

These factors may be influencing the risk of infection the risk of death among those infected. Infection rates could be higher among Black and people because of occupations ( ) , less social distancing ( ) – and especially geography. The parts of the country hit hardest so far by COVID-19 have larger Black and populations. The CDC has produced data showing the percentage of reported deaths by race compared to the population weighted by the geography of the pandemic ( ). These data suggest that Black and white people account for a slightly higher share of the COVID-19 deaths than of the population of locations where the pandemic hit hardest, while people account for a smaller share. Critically, however, these data do not take age into account. (There are concerns about data quality with regard to COVID-19 in general, including the attribution of deaths to the virus, testing rates, and so on; but problems with the data are unlikely to account for these stark differences by race shown here). While geography may be part of the explanation for the race gaps, it does not look to be the main one.

The virus is the positive-strand RNA one with high homology to bat coronavirus. The pathogenic mechanism of the new coronavirus is still unclear, which is a significant obstacle to the development of drugs and patients' rescue. In this study, conserved domain analysis, homology modeling, and molecular docking were made to compare the biological roles of specific proteins belonging to the novel coronavirus. The conserved domain analysis showed envelope protein (E), nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N) and ORF3a had heme linked sites, which Arg134 of ORF3a, Cys44 of E, Ile304 of N were the heme-iron linked site, respectively. ORF3a also possessed the conserved domains of human cytochrome C reductases and bacterial EFeB protein. These three domains were highly overlapping so that ORF3a could dissociate the iron of heme to form porphyrin. Heme linked sites of E protein may be relevant to the high infectivity, and the role of heme linked sites of N protein may be related to the virus replication. The docking results showed that orf1ab, ORF10, and ORF3a proteins coordinated to attack the 1-beta chain of hemoglobin, and some structural and non-structural viral proteins could bind porphyrin. Deoxyhemoglobin was more vulnerable to virus attacks than oxidized hemoglobin. But ORF3a was specific and would not attack blue blood protein, normal cytochrome C, and peroxidase. As for the attack, it would cause increasingly less hemoglobin that could carry oxygen and carbon dioxide, thus producing symptoms of respiratory distress and coagulation reaction, damaging many organs and tissues. The mechanism also interfered with the normal heme anabolic pathway of the human body, expecting to cause human diseases. Based on the small molecule drug library, drugbank, we searched for drugs bound to viral proteins by molecular docking. The results showed that some anticancer drugs coul ...

To ensure that the health system is able to respond  to an outbreak like this, the engagement of community response to improve health outcomes and maintaining health security become crucial. When healthcare centers become fertile grounds for transmission, the role of the community to act as a bridge between people in their own environment and health centers, becomes critical. The role of community in this context also becomes crucial in improving early detection and quick response, because it can reach those who are unreachable to a passive-health system.

France, Belgium, Luxembourg and others have extended so-called ‘winter programmes’ to avoid closing shelters and evicting people onto the streets during the pandemic. Essential social services are maintained despite lock-down measures in many countries, for example in Italy.  Living conditions in shelters, where shared facilities and dormitories are commonplace, make it pretty much impossible to control effectively the transmission of a highly infectious disease. One service providing accommodation to people with health problems who are experiencing homelessness in Paris has recorded 13 cases of COVID-19.

The Covid-19 Eviction Defense Project ( ) , a private effort backed by philanthropic resources and not the government, estimates that 20 percent of America’s 110 million renters are at risk of being evicted by the end of September. The fallout from these evictions won ’t just be economic. In his book Evicted , Matthew Desmond documented how eviction takes a significant health toll on people. Women who are evicted have persistent signs of emotional distress two years after their eviction. The U.S. is hardly ready to track the health impacts of evictions when we don ’t track the evictions themselves, much less have a federal resource to let tenants see if they ’re covered by the coronavirus-related federal eviction bans. While the NLIHC has made an effort to create one ( ) , using what data it’s managed to cull from several government agencies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have not made all of their data publicly available, which means the NLIHC’s tool isn’t comprehensive.

The benefits included in the federal CARES Act ( ) were an important step to respond to the near-term economic impacts of efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19, but this aid is only just beginning to reach households ( ) that may have lost jobs and income more than a month ago. A significant number of immediately-impacted households are renters. The CARES Act included an eviction moratorium ( ) for the one-quarter of renter households in the U.S. in federally-financed properties, and some emergency funding ( ) for critical homeless assistance grants and housing subsidy programs.

Workers who are unable to do their jobs remotely have lost crucial wages as businesses close or reduce their operations to slow the spread of the virus. According to our analysis, about 13 million households rely on at-risk jobs for all of their wages. Even before losing work, these households were more likely to be cost-burdened than those relying on income from other industries. This means the impending recession could be most detrimental for households already struggling with high housing costs.

The letter outlined several priorities needed by the Government in order to be able to continue providing a robust response to the global COVID-19 pandemic.In the letter, the Governor requested additional assistance for hospitals as Puerto Rico continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic. Vázquez Garced urged Congress to provide the island’s healthcare system with the resources necessary so that our healthcare professionals can care for Puerto Rico’s 3.2 million U.S. citizens during the course of this emergency. As the island’s hospital infrastructure continues to be stretched beyond its capacity, the Governor’s Medical Task Force announced last week that the potential peak of COVID-19 infections is anticipated to be from April 15th through May 8th, 2020. Thus, it is essential that Puerto Rico hospitals and healthcare providers receive additional support and resources to attend this expected increase in patients. The Governor reiterated that if these unmet needs are not met, the island’s healthcare could collapse from the anticipated strain on the system. Furthermore, the Governor requested Congress to provide the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) clear authorization to have discretionary authority to advance funds equivalent to the historical Medicare Advantage (MA) reimbursements for services rendered to Medicare-eligible beneficiaries. Currently, the CMS formula only applies to approximately 20 percent of hospital reimbursements under the Medicaid Program in Puerto Rico.

From dedicating streets and sidewalks to critical food and medical services to creating space for learning and play, and offering people space to safely gather, celebrate, worship, and protest, cities are adapting streets to community needs in a time of COVID-19. But a growing number of transportation agencies, particularly in small- and mid-sized cities, face significant budget shortfalls and lack direct federal aid to implement such programs and tailor them to their neighborhoods. NACTO will offer 10 cities within its 84-member network grants of $25,000 each for projects that can help them respond quickly to their immediate pandemic needs. Projects must be developed in partnership with community-based organizations to confront the immediate challenges of this coronavirus and address inequities in communities harmed by COVID-19. Applications can be accessed at nacto.org and are due by July 10. They will be processed swiftly and awarded to winning cities as quickly as possible to aid their recovery.

The original CARES Act ( ) included a provision called the Paycheck Protection Program ( ) , which provided small business loans that are fully forgivable in many circumstances, making the money similar to a grant.

Historically marginalized groups, however, may be unable to access many of the federal resources provided under the CARES Act. For example, Economic Impact Payments ( ) and unemployment insurance ( ) are unavailable to undocumented immigrants, and people experiencing homelessness – who are disproportionately people of color – will likely encounter enormous challenges in accessing Economic Impact Payments. Additionally, programs set up to help small businesses stay afloat during the coronavirus outbreak, like the Paycheck Protection Program, have effectively locked out ( ) as many as 95% of Black-owned businesses, 91% of Latino-owned businesses, 91% of Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander-owned businesses, and 75% of Asian-owned businesses. Moreover, many people exiting the criminal justice system may be unable to access regular HUD assistance and face significant barriers to obtaining affordable, accessible housing.

As a result tests are often restricted to patients at risk of, or those who already have, a life-threatening form of the infection. And while the mortality among these patients is high, it is not a true representation of the mortality with the infection overall.  South Korea undertook a more general study, testing 140,000 persons for the coronavirus. Of them, 6,000 people had the virus and the mortality was 0.6%. Similarly, given the virus’s low mortality, the UK government has said COVID-19 is not to be classified as a ‘ high consequence infectious disease ( ) ‘ (like Ebola). In Italy as well, most deaths ( ) have been recorded among elderly people with a coexisting disease.

Increased efforts for hygiene, facility cleaning, and lowering person-to-person contact were what we initially hoped would help reduce transmission in February and up to early March. However, human behavior and the insidious nature of this virus have made containment and prevention efforts difficult. Many appear to be infected with mild or few symptoms and the virus clearly cannot be reliably detected by screening patients at arrival for appointments. To perform any procedures other than the most urgent of in-person care is unconscionable at present; this would mislead patients into a false sense of security, that all is under control, or that things aren’t bad enough to affect them. *These are inaccurate messages that have the potential to ultimately put patients at risk and undercut the trust patients put in their physicians.* Therefore, every REI group, practice, and physician must universally do their part to make a positive impact. To combat this pandemic, the only responsible actions are to immediately support every means necessary to physically separate people and to support the protection of healthcare workers and infrastructure. Examples from across the globe have now shown us that better hygiene and social distancing are not enough to stem the tide. However, these insufficient measures are the only options for some segments of society, as people must access groceries, those with life-threatening illness must be treated, the dead must be buried, and care must be provided for the children of those performing these functions irrespective of the pandemic’s severity. Unlike these critical functions, *temporarily suspending infertility care is entirely possible and is the responsible choice*. To continue all but the most critical of REI care (e.g. cryopreservation for a cancer patient) is a *direct dismissal of the safety of frontline healthcare colleagues and those in critical jobs who cannot stay home.* Healthcare professionals ...

In Syria, it has been reported ( ) that medical facilities in the area under Kurdish control are very limited, and do not include operational testing facilities. In Myanmar, ethnic armed groups declared ( ) that they could only afford to provide health education, but had no funds for masks or sanitizer, calling on aid agencies and the government to help them. The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan issued a statement ( ) demanding that humanitarian and relief organizations ‘execute their obligation’ of sending aid, also promising ( ) safe passage for humanitarian workers to assist with COVID-19.

In other words, adopting social distancing policies, reducing working hours etc. are measures required not only by wisdom and medical necessity, but by law — in order to protect individuals’ health from the risk posed by the contact with infected (even if asymptomatic) persons. Although the duty to ensure the right to health is one of ‘progressive realization’, it presupposes, at the very least, an obligation to behave proactively and to put in place an effective system of urgent medical care which could cope with life-threatening situations such as an epidemic of the proportions we are experiencing now ( ibid., § 16).

Human-to-human transmission of the disease occurs through the droplets released from the nose or mouth of an infected person. The first cases of COVID-19 were reported in the Hubei province in China in December 2019. In early January 2020, China notified the WHO about the outbreak and by the end of the month China was taking strict measures aimed at its containment, and including the complete sealing off of entire cities, the closure of businesses and schools, and prohibitions of travel and going outdoors.

Needless to say, viruses don’t obey taxonomies of legal entitlement, so such non-universal systems further entrench the virus in societies and aggravate social and economic disruption. If there were any remaining doubt as to how ill-advised (as well as unethical and inconsistent with human rights) market-based allocation of essential health care and punitive austerity measures that retract health and social protection for the poor are, the looming COVID-19 pandemic should surely set those questions to rest.

Through their use, legislation or a section of legislation automatically ceases in its effect after a certain time. In theory, sunset clauses can limit the potential reach and adverse impacts of governments that adopt legislation in response to emergency situations, such as the current Covid-19 pandemic. Indeed, the Coronavirus Act 2020 contains several such provisions and this was viewed as essential in limiting the duration of radical powers. However, it is important to adopt a healthy degree of scepticism. Sunset clauses do not always serve as the safeguard people expect. As the coronavirus emergency continues it is important to reflect on how they work and where they come from, to ensure best practice in the months ahead.

Ireland , whether the nine notifications provide sufficient reasons to prove that the derogations are instrumental in addressing the public emergency that threatens the life of the nations is questionable. Most notifications refer to the WHO declaration of March 11, 2020, and a brief mentioning that the measures are necessary to stop the spread of the virus. While this may be easy to understand in the context of Article 11 of the Convention and Article 2 of the Protocol No. 4, the reasons for derogation from Articles 5 and 6 of the Convention or Article 1 of the Protocol, for instance, are not so straightforward and may prove a challenge for the States should they face claims in Court.

The Coronavirus Bill Explanatory Notes ( ) capture the Act’s existence as emergency legislation that ‘enables the Government to respond to an emergency situation and manage the effects of a COVID-19 pandemic.’ Amongst other things, the Act attempts to increase the available health and social care workforce, ease the burden on frontline staff, and contain and slow the virus. Conversely, the Act also grants police, immigration officers and public health officials new powers to detain “potentially infectious persons” and put them in isolation facilities.  It will also enable the government to prohibit and restrict gatherings and public events for the purpose of curbing the spread of COVID-19.

Hospitals can use data virtualization to deliver integrated, 360-degree patient health views directly to healthcare workers in the emergency room, enabling them to successfully determine the best course of treatment from the offset. This is extremely important, as often, when treating the symptoms of Covid-19, time is of the essence but so is accuracy.

This is all information that can be gleaned quickly and effectively using data virtualization.

In hospitals, data about patients is spread across different systems and departments: EMRs, clinical systems, emergency department computers, pharmacy systems, and the list goes on. In health agencies, geographical data pertaining to where the outbreak is worse, where it is starting, and where workers might be able to contain the disease in terms of the number of hospitals, beds, and trained healthcare workers, is scattered across numerous government departments. And private businesses are even worse off in this respect as they store information on-premises, in the cloud, and across third-party systems that inhibit them from quickly moving the production to a different location to offset the decrease in output from any affected locations.

The number of confirmed cases has exceeded 577,531 globally as of March 27, 2020 ( ) and will continue to rise in the days and weeks ahead. The rapid increase in coronavirus cases and the inadequate amount of lab tests available for people suspected of infection have posed serious risks to public health and efforts in containing the virus.

According to the FDA, there is “no reason to believe” the drug is effective against the coronavirus, and its use increased the risk of serious side effects, such as heart problems. The FDA’s action is a stunning about-face. There are now serious questions about how state and federal regulators and enforcement agencies will view the prescribing decision-making that was done in the heated first months of the pandemic.

Coal closures often quickly eliminate an area’s largest employer, eroding the primary tax base that supports government services and local education, infrastructure, and health care investments—especially in tribal communities affected by coal, already dealing with disproportionately more severe impacts. These services will be desperately needed during and after this economic and public health crisis.

At the same time, they’re projecting sharply lower tax revenues due to the widespread collapse of economic activity brought about by the virus’ spread and needed containment activities. If they respond to this dire fiscal crisis by laying off state and tribal employees, scaling back government contracts for businesses, and cutting public services and other forms of spending, those actions will make the recession worse. (Tribes are uniquely vulnerable to the downturn since tribal businesses deeply affected by the virus and downturn, such as casinos, often generate vital government revenue for tribes to run programs such as public health and child care.) Given the economy’s extremely rapid decline and the extraordinary damage being done to state, tribal, and local budgets, federal policymakers very likely will need to come back and provide more help to states and families affected by the crisis.

Necessary measures to contain the spread of the virus have resulted in restaurant, school, and institution closures and farmers losing critical markets and revenue. Food system workers are being laid off or having their hours drastically reduced as retail and wholesale food businesses temporarily close their doors – with others still working at risk to their health and safety. Commodity markets for agricultural products are eroding rapidly, and market disruptions threaten to restrict access to credit for farmers and ranchers, many already struggling from a long-term slide in farm income. Producers, families, and organizations that support them are all feeling the heightened stress of safely managing daily life through great uncertainty.

These are likely to continue for a time to come, possibly until a vaccine is found. Many artistic and cultural activities will continue to be unviable due to physical distancing measures and more strict controls on the mobility of people within and between countries, which will continue to cause loss of income for artists and organisations. Moreover, we do not all experience this crisis equally: there is increased inequality and vulnerability both between countries, within national populations, and our sectors.

The European Music Council’s (EMC) thoughts are with all those who have suffered bereavement and sincerely hopes that anyone sadly affected by the virus gets well soon. The music sector has already been hit heavily and will continue to be massively affected by the measures taken to prevent any further spread of the virus. The important health and safety measure of official authorities lead to extensive cancellations of musical events, such as concerts, workshops, conferences, festivals, music and instrumental lessons, music production and much more. The economic and social consequences of these cancellations will have a negative effect on a thriving musical landscape in Europe which consists of many small businesses and a wide range of self-employed musicians and composers who might face serious threats to their existence and indeed survival, as a result. Therefore, we call upon all political decision makers to include the music sector at large in all planned aid efforts and appreciate that several announcements have already been made in this regard. Because of the vulnerability of the sector, these measures need to be taken quickly and in a non-bureaucratic way to prevent individuals as well as organisations of all sizes from financial ruin.

Given the Center for Disease Control’s (CDC) recommendations ( ) for social distancing and frequent hand washing with soap and water, that are nearly impossible to implement in secure settings , along with many local juvenile justice and correctional responses to end visitation and programming from external volunteers to slow the spread of COVID-19, youth in correctional settings remain at high risk of contracting the illnes s-- particularly those youth with underlying medical conditions such as asthma, and immunosuppress ive illnesses. Young people housed in adult facilities ( ) face particularly difficult conditions. Furthermore, as facilities decide to end in-person family visits, as schools close (including those in correctional settings), and volunteer programming is reduced or stopped— stressors on children in custody will increase ( ). Communication on what protective measures are taking place in facilities and community supervision is essential and must be clear and frequent between juvenile justice staff, young people and families.

This percentage is very similar to that found in adults who have been in contact with an infected partner (18.9%). This leads the researchers to the conclusion that, *when exposed to a source of infection,* children are infected at the same rate as adults ( ).

Here are the facts as we know them: although COVID-19 is certainly frightening, it is very unusual for children or otherwise healthy parents under 60 to become very sick. Therefore, you can honestly answer your children’s fears by saying that you’re not worried about them or yourselves. This is especially important because public health experts predict most of us will be infected before the pandemic is over—but the vast majority of people will have only a mild illness. Should the day come when you or your children are infected with COVID-19, they will be prepared and less frightened.

Spotlight recently spoke with Lili Farhang, Co-Director of Human Impact Partners, on their work related to economic security, and how it connects to the international outbreak of COVID-19, most commonly known as Coronavirus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have advised the American public to limit social interactions, leading schools to close and some employers allowing their full-time employees to work from home. Although the guidelines aim to prevent the public from contracting the illness, some experts believe that these guidelines don’t afford the same opportunities to part-time employees, home health-care nurses, and low-income service employees who are either required to interact with people to complete their job, or who must physically go to work in order to financially support themselves and their families. Concurrently, state and federal laws don’t guarantee employees – either part- or full-time – with paid sick leave, childcare assistance, or adequate medical funding to ensure people are tested and receive the necessary treatment. Farhang discusses these issues as well as policies that might be fast-tracked in order to provide relief for low-income families who will be disproportionately impacted by the outbreak. The conversation has been lightly edited for clarity and length.

Much is unknown about exactly how this particular virus causes the disease known as COVID-19, but much is known about how best to stop it. The basic principles of disease mitigation that have worked reliably for millennia— hygiene ( ) and social distancing—are no less applicable today.

Cases of COVID-19, the disease the virus causes, have been documented all over the country. It is highly contagious, though not extremely contagious like measles or Ebola — hand washing and “social distancing” can make a huge difference in its ultimate transmission rate. As of this writing on March 12, there are many places in the US that have not documented “community spread” of cases. But the evidence of other countries where the virus arrived in previous weeks suggests that everyone, anywhere in the continental US, should assume that the virus is present in their community even if there have not yet been any reports of disease.

The CDC recommends the use of simple cloth face coverings to slow the spread of the virus, given that a significant portion of individuals with COVID-19 lack symptoms. The simple cloth face coverings recommended by the CDC can be made at home from common household materials. The CDC made clear that the cloth face coverings being recommended are not surgical masks or N-95 respirators, which it recommends reserving for healthcare workers. The cloth face coverings are not subject to OSHA’s respiratory protection standard.

It also provides information on what preventative measures do work. Communicate on a regular basis with employees to let them know of any ongoing developments and what the company is doing to handle COVID-19. Truthful communication will build trust, while lack of information or disinformation will result in mistrust. If an employee tests positive for the virus, tell the employees they have been in contact with that they have been exposed to the virus at work. (However, respecting sick employees’ privacy is important, so don’t reveal their names.) Do you communicate current status via live ticker on the intranet?The U.S. CDC has four risk categories ( ) for individuals. It may be helpful to share these with employees. Some employees may be reassured to learn that they are not at risk.Sick employees at work should be isolated from other employees and sent home immediately.Tell employees that if they have symptoms of respiratory illness, they should not come to work and should stay home until they have had no fever for 24 hours. **

Scott Gottlieb, the previous FDA commissioner, explained that in Seattle there has been better testing, and we are seeing infection there: “The reason why we knew early about Seattle outbreak of covid-19 was because of sentinel surveillance work by independent scientists. Such surveillance never got totally underway in other cities. So other U.S. hot spots may not be fully detected yet.” According to The Atlantic ( ) , Vice President Mike Pence promised that “roughly 1.5 million tests” would be available this week, but less than 2,000 people have been tested throughout the US at this point.

But another implication of the experience in Singapore and Hong Kong is that these essentially invisible cases of the coronavirus may not be driving as many serious infections as some scientists have projected ( ). Health officials there did not conduct mass testing of the population to look for infected people without symptoms. They focussed on aggressively searching out and testing only those who developed suspicious symptoms or had high-risk exposures in the community. They accepted that the virus might circulate among people who notice nothing. Yet their strategy brought cases under control.

17.86	281	[oxygen patients respiratory problem patient mask making]	https://www.novusmedical.ca/covid19-the-hiox	The problem is how to deliver oxygen of any concentration to a patient who is on reverse isolation for febrile respiratory infection (FRI) or airborne precautions such as COVID-19? The HiOx oxygen mask accomplishes this task by making a closed patient breathing system that delivers oxygen enriched gas and with the addition of a respiratory filter, filters the exhaled breath. The HiOx has two head straps to ensure a nice tight seal on the patients face. The secret is in the sequential dilution valves that direct fresh oxygen gas source to the patient and then directs the exhaled gas through the respiratory filter. (Respiratory filter sold separately) The Hi-Ox Mask is a proven solution that delivers higher FiO2’s than any mask, at ANY flow. The Hi-Ox can deliver greater than 80% oxygen to the alveolar level at 8lpm and we can prove it.  Delivering >90% oxygen to severely hypoxic patients is simplified by the design and performance of the Hi-Ox.  Transporting patients who require very high flows is always a problem when typical E-cylinder regulators only go to 10 -15 LPM. The Hi-Ox solves that problem, by delivering a higher FiO2 with a lower flow needed as compared to other oxygen masks. The HiOx is ideal for EMT, transfer services and internal transports within the hospital.  The Hi-Ox solution enables patients requiring high flow oxygen to be discharged sooner to home or hospice centres, making them treatable with oxygen concentrators.

PPE is necessary to keep medical staff safe when they are treating or testing patients suspected of having COVID-19. Due to worldwide shortages, even the most prestigious hospitals and health systems are not able to access gowns, gloves, masks, and other necessary materials. As a community health center, it is exponentially difficult to access PPE, as we are often relegated to the bottom of the priority list for resources. Supply chains have dried up, and NEMS is currently experiencing two-months or longer wait time for PPE including hand sanitizer and face shields. National and state stockpiles have recently been made available, but as of now are reserved for hospitals and first responders only. This leaves little to no resources for community health centers; even though it is our core responsibility as preventive health care providers to test and treat COVID-19 patients and divert them from the more costly hospital or emergency room setting. We simply do not have the basic resources to address and contain this pandemic within our community, even if it is expected of us to do so.

This rapid development is only possible because of public, taxpayer funding of NIH research on coronaviruses. [1] ( #_ftn1 ) An investigative report released today revealed that while pharmaceutical companies have devoted startlingly little resources to research and development relating to coronaviruses, NIH has spent nearly $700 million on coronavirus research and development. While much of this funding focused on early-stage research, all six active coronavirus clinical trials that began prior to the COVID-19 outbreak received public and taxpayer support. [2] ( #_ftn2 )
