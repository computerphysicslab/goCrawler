This is concordant with recent clinical observations which show that COVID-19 exhibits a reduced interferon response in comparison to other respiratory viruses such as influenza and SARS.

Studies now consistently ( ) indicate that infectivity starts before symptoms do ( ) , that it peaks right around the day that they start, and that it declines substantially by five days or so. This is the pattern we see in influenza. But it’s the opposite of the pattern we saw with the coronavirus that caused China’s SARS outbreak eighteen years ago. That virus had a low risk of transmission until after five days from the onset of symptoms, which made it easier to identify and isolate cases before others got infected. No large-scale lockdown was necessary. It seems that there are also plenty of people who are infected by the virus that causes COVID -19 who never become symptomatic, especially children. So far, studies of transmission networks have not revealed such silent carriers to be a major source of spread. Nonetheless, patients who do not yet show symptoms, or have just begun to, are turning out to be important vectors of disease.

Their followers have threatened health officials, including Tony Fauci and his family ( ) ; refused to wear masks; refused to cooperate with contact tracers ( ) ; and rejected proven basic public health advice about social distancing. Representative Louie Gohmert, who refused to wear a mask in the Capitol and reportedly discouraged his staff and interns ( ) from wearing masks, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 ( ) and is being treated with hydroxychloroquine ( ) , a drug that Trump has endorsed but that has failed in clinical trials ( ).

It is still unclear to what extent children, especially younger ones, are likely to get infected or transmit the infection to others compared to adults. However, where there is already widespread community transmission, as is the case in many areas in the U.S., there is clearly a risk of spread associated with reopening schools. This challenge may be more pronounced where testing and contact tracing capacity is limited. As such, the risk of re-opening schools needs to be considered carefully in light of the recognized benefits of in-person education.

For example, during the response to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 ( ) , the country prioritized population health over concerns for the economic impact of its response. Officials deployed a multi-sector response incorporating military, public security services and grassroot organizations while ensuring that transparent risk communication and effective community mobilization were emphasized throughout the outbreak. These lessons were certainly pulled into its current strategy. The country has also faced other outbreaks ( ) from which it drew similar lessons including Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, avian influenza, measles and dengue.

One surprising aspect of this pandemic is that children appear to be infected by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19, far less frequently than adults and, when infected, typically have mild symptoms, 1 ( #ref-1 ) – 3 ( #ref-3 ) although emerging reports of a novel Kawasaki disease–like multisystem inflammatory syndrome necessitate continued surveillance in pediatric patients. 4 ( #ref-4 ) , 5 ( #ref-5 ) However, a major question remains unanswered: to what extent are children responsible for SARS-CoV-2 transmission? Resolving this issue is central to making informed public health decisions, ranging from how to safely re-open schools, child care facilities, and summer camps down to the precautions needed to obtain a throat culture in an uncooperative child. To date, few published data are available to help guide these decisions.

That happens when virus particles contained in smaller droplets don’t settle out within six feet and instead hang in the air and drift on currents. Airborne transmission is thought to have been a factor in the coronavirus’ spread among members of a Washington choir, through an apartment building in Hong Kong, and in a restaurant in Wuhan, China, Nardell said.

This novel corona virus SARS-CoV-2 has a specific tropism for the low respiratory airways, but causes severe pneumonia in a low percentage of patients. However, the rapid spread of the infection during this pandemic is causing the need to hospitalize a high number of patients. Pneumonia in COVID-19 has peculiar features and can be studied by lung ultrasound in the early approach to suspected patients. The sonographic signs are non-specific when considered alone, but observation of some aspects of vertical artifacts can enhance the diagnostic power of the ultrasound examination. Also, the combination of sonographic signs in patterns and their correlation with blood exams in different phenotypes of the disease may allow for a reliable characterization and be of help in triaging and admitting patients.

Nasal respiratory epithelial cells and olfactory epithelial support cells have been shown to express high levels of ACE2 proteins used by the SARS-Cov2 virus, which causes the COVID-19 syndrome, to infect cells [ 2 ( ) ]. Previously described human strains of coronavirus have also been demonstrated to invade the central nervous system and propagate from within the olfactory bulb [ 3 ( ) ]. It is therefore perhaps no surprise that alterations in sense of smell would be reported by patients with COVID-19.

This virus genetically is very similar to a bat coronavirus in the subgenus Sarbecovirus [ 2 ( ) ]. The WHO named the disease as COVID-19 [ 3 ( ) ] and it spread all over the world rapidly less than 3 month s. corona viruses can be classified into four genera (α, β, γ, and δ) and they are detected in a very wide selection of animal species, including humans [ 4 ( ) ]. The virus that causes the COVID-19 infection belongs to the β coronaviruses family. Since the beginning of the twenty-first century, three coronaviruses crossed the species barrier and causes deadly pneumonia in humans: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [ 5 ( ) ], Middle-East respiratory syndrome coronavirus [ 6 ( ) ], and SARS-CoV-2 [ 7 ( ) ].

Most patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections have reportedly had mild to severe respiratory illness with symptoms such as fever, cough and shortness of breath, which might appear 2–14 d after exposure. However, there are other patients who are diagnosed by a positive RT–PCR test but are either asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic 2 ( #ref-CR2 ) , 3 ( #ref-CR3 ) , 4 ( #ref-CR4 ) , 5 ( #ref-CR5 ) , 6 ( ). Increasing evidence has shown that asymptomatic individuals can spread the virus efficiently, and the emergence of these silent spreaders of SARS-CoV-2 has caused difficulties in the control of the epidemic 2 ( ) , 5 ( ). However, our understanding of the clinical features and immune responses of asymptomatic individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection is limited.

Even with a vaccine that is rigorously evaluated and shows some real efficacy, the challenges will be acute. But imagine all this effort going into a vaccine with dubious effects. Not only would that be a colossal waste of time and money; with little protection against the virus, people may decide they are safe and can stop practicing social distancing or wearing masks. When the truth comes out, the reputation of all vaccines will suffer a tremendous hit, as will the scientific community and the industry that went along with the scheme. If people get infected because they thought they were protected—if we don’t stop the Trump administration from juking the stats ( ) to give them a political victory this fall—we should all hang our heads in shame.

Current evidence suggests that most transmission occurs from symptomatic people through close contact with others. Accordingly, most recommendations by WHO on personal protective measures (such as use of masks and physical distancing) are based on controlling transmission from symptomatic patients, including patients with mild symptoms who are not easy to identify early on.

48.60	342	[the covid binding protease main flavonol flavonoids]	https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2020/RA/D0RA03582C	In December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) commenced in Wuhan, China and affected around 210 countries and territories in a matter of weeks. It has a phylogenetic similarity to SARS-CoV and it was named coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and caused severe acute respiratory syndrome that could lead to death. One of the promising therapeutic strategies for virus infection is the search for enzyme inhibitors among natural compounds using molecular docking in order to obtain products with minimal side effects. COVID-19 virus main protease plays a vital role in mediating viral transcription and replication, introducing it as an attractive antiviral agent target. Metabolic profiling of the aqueous extract of Salvadora persica L. (Salvadoraceae) aerial parts dereplicated eleven known flavonol glycosides using LC-HRESIMS. All the annotated flavonoids exhibited significant binding stability at the N3 binding site to different degrees, except isorhamnetin-3- O -β- D -glucopyranoside, when compared with the currently used COVID-19 main protease inhibitor, darunavir. Structural similarity between the identified flavonoids enabled the study of the relationship between their structure and interactions with the receptor in the N3 binding site of the COVID-19 main protease. The results indicate that the basic flavonol nucleus possesses activity itself. Moreover, the presence of a rutinose moiety at the 3 position of ring C and absence of an O -methyl group in ring B of the flavonol structure could increase the binding stability. This study provides a scientific basis for the health benefits of the regular use of S. persica as it leaches bioactive flavonoids in the aqueous saliva.

This percentage is very similar to that found in adults who have been in contact with an infected partner (18.9%). This leads the researchers to the conclusion that, *when exposed to a source of infection,* children are infected at the same rate as adults ( ). But the disease is much milder in children than in adults, since over 99% of minors showed no symptoms, or if they did, they were insignificant.

In fact, both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV sequences have higher normalized CAI values than nCoV-2019. In addition, nCoV-2019 (as well as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV) also have high CAI values to hosts that are even more unlikely than snakes to serve as the reservoir, including several fungi.

In 2003, our health-care system was abruptly stressed with the emergence of the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) crisis, with 238 infections (including health-care professionals) and 33 deaths. Since then, Singapore has progressively strengthened its ability and resilience in managing further infectious disease outbreaks. Among others, this has included the construction of new purpose-built medical treatment and quarantine facilities at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases in Singapore. Importantly, our lessons from SARS have also culminated in the development and adoption of a systematic outbreak response system, termed DORSCON (Disease Outbreak Response System Condition) 6. DORSCON is a color-coded framework (green, yellow, orange, and red) depicting various alert levels corresponding to disease severity and spread ( Fig. 1 ( javascript:void(0) ) ). This has served us well during the SARS and H1N1 influenza outbreaks and is currently used in managing the ongoing COVID-19 crisis.

We’ve learned that the CDC is making, at best, a debilitating mistake: combining test results that diagnose current coronavirus infections with test results that measure whether someone has ever had the virus. The upshot is that the government’s disease-fighting agency is overstating the country’s ability to test people who are sick with COVID-19. The agency confirmed to The Atlantic on Wednesday that it is mixing the results of viral and antibody tests, even though the two tests reveal different information and are used for different reasons.

Among other things, they permit hospitals to take away ventilators from those who use them on an ongoing basis in the community or at a long-term care facility if they seek hospital care. Not only is this a concerning precedent, it also interferes with the trust in the medical system that we need to combat the virus: Chronic ventilator users may have reason to avoid seeking needed hospital care if they become infected, based on a well-founded fear of being sacrificed “for the greater good.”

Then you help them quarantine for two weeks—almost everyone who becomes sick will show symptoms within 14 days—so they do not accidentally spread the virus any further. The goal is to stop the chain of transmission, says Emily Gurley, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, who has created a free online course ( ) to train contact tracers.

(Fujifilm Toyama Chemical Co., Ltd.) It was approved by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare in March 2014, limiting the indications and effects to “emerging or re-emerging influenza virus infections (only if other anti-influenza virus drugs are ineffective or insufficiently effective).” The mechanism of action is that triphosphorylated form (T-705RTP) converted in vivo selectively inhibits viral RNA polymerase, so it is expected to be effective against RNA viruses other than influenza virus, but there is no evidence of utility for SARS-CoV2 infection.

As of January 23, there are over *800 cases ( )* of 2019-nCoV confirmed globally, including cases in at least 20 regions in China and nine The first reported infected individuals, some of whom showed symptoms as early as *December 8* ( ) , were discovered to be among stallholders from the Wuhan South China Seafood Market. Subsequently, the wet market was closed on Jan 1. The virus causing the outbreak was quickly determined to be a *novel coronavirus ( )*. On January 10, gene sequencing further determined it to be the new Wuhan coronavirus, namely *2019-nCoV ( )* , a betacoronavirus, related to the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome virus (MERS-CoV) and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome virus (SARSCoV). However, the mortality and transmissibility of 2019-nCoV are still unknown, and likely to vary from those of the prior referenced coronaviruses.

CDC guidance for the care of patients with COVID-19 therefore recommends that N95 respirators be worn by staff present during these procedures. But the lack of evidence that the virus aerosolizes in any other situation is one reason why the CDC tells us that surgical (“droplet”) masks can be worn during the routine care of people with COVID-19 infection.

The policy rewarded couples for having a single child with better houses, free education and healthcare, and cash bonuses. The birth rate dropped from 2.1 to about 1.4 children per woman. The policy was met with resistance especially in the rural areas as women avoided giving birth in hospitals and families lied in population censuses resulting in skewed data.

This is, of course, no small matter. Cancelling an event often means both the host and participants eating sunk costs, and many nonprofits must be careful with these kinds of outlays. Even NPQ got a note from a grant officer last week suggesting they would consider sharing some of the costs of cancelled events. At the time, it seemed a little extreme, but it seems that organizations and municipalities are falling in line around preventing this potential pandemic.

This means they’re providing necessary telecommuter accommodations to their employees and students, in order to promote social distancing and help limit the reach of the virus. In early March, Amazon asked their Seattle staff ( ) to work from home if they could, and hundreds of thousands of federal workers are expected to be asked to work from home ( ) in the coming days. More than 100 colleges have closed in-person classes and switched to online teaching programs ( ).

I can recognize the outbreak is in my area, but also recognize there are many ways to be cautious, concern, but move forward.

At first, the grants were prescriptive and supported only a single counselling provider for each grantee. But it became clear that organizations wanted and needed more autonomy to determine the type of support their staff needed. Some social change organizations wanted to give staff access to therapy; others already had comprehensive medical insurance with mental health counselling services. A couple of organizations felt that hosting a staff retreat would boost team well-being more than anything else, and used the funding to support a retreat for strategic thinking, planning, and celebration of accomplishments.

Yet that’s the reality we are facing. That is not because of the coronavirus. That is because of the state our cities were in when the pandemic hit. It’s easy to blame the hydroxychloroquine-popping man-baby in the White House, but the truth is that he has very little to do with the fact that our cities have failed us ( ). Until we can fully engage with the erasure of communities, structural racism, and unequal distribution of wealth that got us here, our cities will not crawl out from under this crisis.

The valuable time saved in getting definitive results in real-time allowed us to effectively respond to protect residents in ways that would not have been possible otherwise. Our laboratory’s ability to gear up to do the testing was only possible because our state had the foresight to have invested in the highly trained staff, necessary facilities, and resources before the pandemic hit.

The disruptive effects from this pandemic are different than what nonprofits have faced in the past. Natural disasters are bound by geography and a recession is contained to the market, but a pandemic cuts across all sectors. Revenue loss is defined not by source of funding but tied to people gathering to receive or enjoy the services of our nonprofits. Organizations called to serve those who are hungry, are in need of shelter, or are in search of healthcare face exceptional challenges. They have to manage increases in demand amid constrained capacity, concerns for the health and safety of staff and clients, and availability of workers who don’t have the privilege of working remotely or who are unable to both work and care for children who are home because of school and day care closures.

Elderly and people of all ages with severe underlying health conditions, such as heart or lung disease, and diabetes, appear to be at higher risk of developing serious illness. If symptoms develop such as fever, cough, and difficulty breathing, and you have been in close contact with a person known to have COVID-19 or have recently traveled from an area with ongoing spread of COVID-19, the CDC advises individuals to stay home and contact their health care provider. Recognizing persons who are at risk for COVID-19 is a critical component of identifying cases and preventing further transmission. Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) ( )

SARS-CoV-2 is able to spread efficiently from person-to-person and cases have been detected in most countries. On March 11, the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was classified as a pandemic by the WHO ( ). Transmission characteristics and the associated morbidity and mortality, viral pathogenesis, host immunity, natural history, and host range are currently poorly understood. Research is an important component of the public health emergency response before, during and after the emergency. Given this, there is an urgent public health need to better understand particularly to improve understanding of fundamental virology, immunology, and the development of animal models, reagents, and medical countermeasures and to share findings quickly and broadly.

However, they can also occur in other regions, for example, through transmission by returning travellers. Emerging diseases are infections that are new in a population, or are already known but have increased rapidly in incidence or regional distribution. Mosquito-borne viruses such as Zika, dengue and chikungunya viruses generally cause febrile diseases with unspecific flu-like symptoms. In the further course of disease, severe complications such as encephalitis or haemorrhaging can occur. Moreover, neurological abnormalities in newborns are associated with Zika virus infection. In addition to viral diseases, parasitic infections, for example with Echinococcus, Plasmodium, Strongyloides, Trypanosoma or Schistosoma, also play a role in humans. The symptoms of a parasitic infection are extremely variable and sometimes occur after months or years, as is the case with echinococcosis.

47.68	861	[the antibody igm igg test positive coronavirus]	https://www.biomedomics.com/products/infectious-disease/covid-19-rt/	The BioMedomics COVID-19 IgM-IgG Rapid Test was tested using clinical samples at Jiangsu Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Jiangsu CDC), Nanjing, China. The COVID-19 IgM-IgG Rapid Test is intended to test IgM and IgG separately. The test was validated against a panel of previously frozen samples consisting of twenty six (26) SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (both IgM and IgG) positive and eighty (80) antibody-negative plasma samples. The antibody-positive samples were collected from clinically-confirmed COVID-19 infected patients and the presence of anti-SARS-Cov-2 antibodies were confirmed with a chemiluminescent IgM and IgG assay (magnetic particles). Within the 26 positive samples, 22 samples tested positive for both IgM and IgG antibodies by BioMedomics COVID-19 IgM-IgG Rapid Test, 4 samples tested positive for only IgG. All 80 negative specimens were collected from healthy donors and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 antibody negative with both the COVID-19 IgM-IgG Rapid Test and the chemiluminescent IgM and IgG assay. Testing was performed using one lot of the COVID-19 IgM-IgG Rapid Test. Confidence intervals for sensitivity and specificity were calculated per a score method described in CLSI EP12-A2 (2008). The results and data analysis are shown in the tables below.

Two of these high-risk types (HPV16 and HPV18) account for about 70% all cases of cervical cancer worldwide. Vaccines have been developed that help the immune system to recognize certain HPV types. Because cervical cancer can take several years to develop, regulatory bodies and international health agencies such as the World Health Organization (WHO) regard cervical lesions as the preferred outcome measure for HPV vaccine trials.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the current “best estimate” for the fatality rate among Americans with COVID-19 symptoms is 0.4 percent. The CDC also estimates that 35 percent of people infected by the COVID-19 virus never develop symptoms. Those numbers imply that the virus kills less than 0.3 percent of people infected by it—far lower than the infection fatality rates (IFRs) assumed by the alarming projections that drove the initial government response to the epidemic, including broad business closure and stay-at-home orders.”

While Congress did not allocate any money specifically for COVID-19 treatment or coverage for the uninsured, President Trump has stated his intention to reimburse hospitals for treating the uninsured by tapping a new $100 billion in funding for hospitals and other health care entities included in the third stimulus, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. The legislation provided little detail ( ) about how funding would be distributed, giving significant discretion to the Secretary of Health and Human Services.

Despite intense research efforts, how, when and where new diseases appear are still a source of considerable uncertainty. A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. As of 25 January 2020, at least 1,975 cases had been reported since the first patient was hospitalized on 12 December 2019. Epidemiological investigations have suggested that the outbreak was associated with a seafood market in Wuhan. Here we study a single patient who was a worker at the market and who was admitted to the Central Hospital of Wuhan on 26 December 2019 while experiencing a severe respiratory syndrome that included fever, dizziness and a cough. Metagenomic RNA sequencing 4 ( #CR4 ) of a sample of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from the patient identified a new RNA virus strain from the family Coronaviridae , which is designated here ‘WH-Human 1’ coronavirus (and has also been referred to as ‘2019-nCoV’). Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that the virus was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity) to a group of SARS-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus) that had previously been found in bats in China 5 ( #CR5 ). This outbreak highlights the ongoing ability of viral spill-over from animals to cause severe disease in humans.

The social distancing measures being implemented will likely result in fewer daily infections but also come at great societal costs and are likely untenable for more than a few months, if that.

40.82	4703	[the application research nih grants proposed federal]	https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-20-178.html	SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus that has recently been identified as the causative agent of COVID-19, a respiratory disease that exhibits a wide range of clinical outcomes from mild disease to severe viral pneumonia and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). SARS-CoV-2 is able to spread efficiently from person-to-person and cases have been detected in most countries. On March 11, the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was classified as a pandemic by the WHO ( ). Transmission characteristics and the associated morbidity and mortality, viral pathogenesis, host immunity, natural history, and host range are currently poorly understood. Research is an important component of the public health emergency response before, during and after the emergency. Given this, there is an urgent public health need to better understand particularly to improve understanding of fundamental virology, immunology, and the development of animal models, reagents, and medical countermeasures and to share findings quickly and broadly.

However, the shortage of testing services to detect infected persons makes this approach subject to error due to its underdetection of early cases in the U.S. Our new approach overcomes this limitation and provides data supporting the public policy decisions intended to combat the spread of COVID-19 epidemic.

56.50	1014	[the disease health science covid cdc surveillance]	https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~badityap/covid.html	The rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 has led many countries and regions to enact various interventions, such as social distancing, school closures, and border control, in order to mitigate the growth of infection. Understanding the effects of these interventions is particularly important since each strategy comes with its side effects. We wanted to understand the impact of intervention strategies and their combinations on the disease spread. California Gov. Gavin Newsom mentioned 'Localism is Determinative' for the Covid epidemic. We can clearly see that in our detailed intervention overlays over the disease trajectories of different regions.

Practically, it makes not much difference whether, as per Sunetra Gupta ( ) , the 40,000 officially-counted coronavirus deaths in the UK are 0.1% of 40 million people infected, or, as per Karl Friston’s theory implies, they are more like 0.5% of 8 million people infected with the remaining 32 million shielded from infection by mysterious “immunological dark material”. If you are exposed to the virus and it is destroyed in your body by mucosal antibodies or T-cells or clever genes so that you never become fully infected and don’t even notice it, should that count as an infection? The effect is the same: 40,000 deaths, not 400,000.

For example, they could recommend trusted, accessible locations for new testing sites and advise on how to diversify the pool of contact tracers ( ) , who will be crucial to tamping down the spread of infection in reopened communities. They could also collaborate with government leaders to ensure that all people who are infected with coronavirus (or exposed to someone infected) have a safe, secure, and acceptable place to isolate or quarantine for 14 days. Key partners could include community health centers, small business associations, community organizing groups, and workers’ rights organizations, among others. Ultimately, state and local leaders should measure the success of their response based not only on total death counts and aggregate economic impacts but also on the health and social outcomes of the most marginalized.

Some governors, mayors, education authorities and employers have led the way by enforcing social distancing, closing campuses and other places, and channeling resources to support the most vulnerable. And the civic fabric of some communities has fostered the responsibility and altruism of millions of ordinary citizens who have stayed home, lost income, kept their kids inside, self-quarantined, refrained from hoarding, supported each other, and even pooled medical supplies and other resources to bolster health workers. The coronavirus is this century’s most urgent challenge to humanity. Harnessing a new sense of solidarity, citizens of states and cities will rise to face the enormous challenges ahead such as climate change and transforming our era of historic inequality into one of economic inclusion.

In particular, activities like chanting, shouting, singing, and group recitation negate the risk-reduction achieved through 6 feet of physical distancing.

To preempt this potential danger, employers should ensure business continuity plans take into account and prepare for biological threats. SHRM recommends employers consider the following preventive measures: Actively encourage sick employees to stay home, send symptomatic employees home until they are able to return to work safely, and require employees returning from high-risk areas to telework during the incubation period. As with any widespread virus, bacterium or other biological threat, employers should take care to protect their workers and their future business operations. We will continue to monitor the COVID-19 outbreak closely, following guidance from the World Health Organization, the UAE National Emergency Crisis and Disasters Management Authority, India's national health agency, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
