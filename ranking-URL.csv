That experience can include matching you with advertisements they think are relevant to your online activities (called “behavioral advertising”). Some first party sites may feel that — for their site to function best or to give you the best experience — they and their third parties need an exception to your general request not to be tracked. They may explain this need and ask you for your agreement. If you give it, they then ask your browser to remember that they have an exception to your general Do Not Track request. If you do not grant them the exception, your online experience may be impacted. Your browser may offer ways to see or manage what sites have recorded such exception grants from you.
