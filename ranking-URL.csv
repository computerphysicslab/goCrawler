Much remains unknown about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, and no vaccine or definitive treatment has yet emerged. As a result, clinicians who care for infected patients have raced to develop solutions to technical challenges posed by a highly transmissible, potentially lethal virus that enters via the respiratory tract. For anesthesiologists in particular, strategies to reduce viral transmission during airway management have led to novel technical strategies, including aerosol boxes and manual ventilation techniques.

COVID-19 is caused by infection with a new coronavirus (called SARS-CoV-2) and flu is caused by infection with influenza viruses ( ). Because some of the symptoms of flu and COVID-19 are similar, it may be hard to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone, and testing may be needed to help confirm a diagnosis.

Studies now consistently ( ) indicate that infectivity starts before symptoms do ( ) , that it peaks right around the day that they start, and that it declines substantially by five days or so. This is the pattern we see in influenza. But it’s the opposite of the pattern we saw with the coronavirus that caused China’s SARS outbreak eighteen years ago. That virus had a low risk of transmission until after five days from the onset of symptoms, which made it easier to identify and isolate cases before others got infected. No large-scale lockdown was necessary. It seems that there are also plenty of people who are infected by the virus that causes COVID -19 who never become symptomatic, especially children. So far, studies of transmission networks have not revealed such silent carriers to be a major source of spread. Nonetheless, patients who do not yet show symptoms, or have just begun to, are turning out to be important vectors of disease.

Kelvin notes that the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine will face a challenge similar to our yearly influenza ( ) vaccine: providing protection from infection in both the upper and lower respiratory tract (the nose ( ) and the lungs ( ) ). The ideal vaccine will both prevent transmission by stopping viral replication in the nose and throat and also protect against serious disease due to viral replication in the lungs. That might be a tough combination to find. “Blocking infection in the nose is often a problem with vaccines that target respiratory viruses and are administered intramuscularly,” says Kelvin.

The authors’ point is that the vaccine trials should also be looking at transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus) as an endpoint in addition to protection against covid-19 (the disease). However the authors criticize current clinical trial design for not looking at virus transmission. I don’t know if there is any publicly available pre-clinical data regarding effect of any of the candidate vaccines on virus transmission. I’m not an immunologist, so would be interested in thoughts on this from folks better informed than myself.

But the timing and symptoms in the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract set COVID-19 apart.
34.59	7519	[symptoms covid likely patients symptom fever path]	https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2020.00473/full	The current pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has undergone an observed exponential increase of cases that has overrun hospitals across the world ( 1 ( #B1 ) ). Many people have mild forms of the disease and are advised not to go to the hospital or to seek a diagnostic test because they can recover at home. A large number of others are asymptomatic ( 2 ( #B2 ) ). Infected individuals are highly contagious and can transmit the disease even if they are asymptomatic, and this fact furthers the need to isolate and test often ( 2 ( #B2 ) ). In addition, COVID-19 is two to three times more contagious than influenza ( 3 ( #B3 ) ). Due to these characteristics, outbreaks of COVID-19 occur in clusters ( 4 ( #B4 ) ). Identifying COVID-19 early could reduce the number and size of clusters, but early symptoms are not well-defined. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the USA and the World Health Organization (WHO) currently advise the public to call their doctor if they believe they have been exposed to COVID-19 or exhibit fever and cough ( 5 ( #B5 ) ). However, fever and cough are associated with other respiratory diseases such as influenza ( 6 ( #B6 ) – 8 ( #B8 ) ). Influenza, with an estimated number of symptomatic cases in the millions annually in the U.S. alone ( 9 ( #B9 ) ), also is commonly associated with fever and cough ( 6 ( #B6 ) ). Similarly to COVID-19, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are respiratory illnesses contracted from coronaviruses called the MERS-Related Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-Related Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), respectively ( 7 ( #B7 ) ). The symptoms of these diseases also overlap with COVID-19. The capacity to discern differences in these common symptoms, such as order of occurrence and likely first symptoms, would aid in early recognition. If health care workers recorded and pub ...

This novel corona virus SARS-CoV-2 has a specific tropism for the low respiratory airways, but causes severe pneumonia in a low percentage of patients. However, the rapid spread of the infection during this pandemic is causing the need to hospitalize a high number of patients. Pneumonia in COVID-19 has peculiar features and can be studied by lung ultrasound in the early approach to suspected patients. The sonographic signs are non-specific when considered alone, but observation of some aspects of vertical artifacts can enhance the diagnostic power of the ultrasound examination. Also, the combination of sonographic signs in patterns and their correlation with blood exams in different phenotypes of the disease may allow for a reliable characterization and be of help in triaging and admitting patients.

Severe emotional stress had been reported during or after the infectious diseases outbreak among medical care workers in previous studies, including the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic [ 3 ( ) ], 2014 Ebola virus disease and 2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak [ 4 ( ) , 5 ( ) ].

Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. While roughly 80% of cases report mild symptoms, some progress into severe pneumonia and multi-organ failure and can lead to death. On January 21, 2020, the first set of individuals in the United States ( ) tested positive for COVID-19. The virus has since spread across all 50 states and the number of individuals testing positive for COVID-19 continues to rapidly grow each day.

In fact, it’s in an entirely different ( ) genus ( ) of coronaviruses.
43.12	1941	[ginn stanway numbers post pandemic medium political]	https://slate.com/technology/2020/03/armchair-epidemiology-coronavirus.html	One reason back-of-the-envelope hot takes are thriving is that the science of ongoing epidemics is inherently uncertain. And in the U.S., the testing fiasco has only amplified that uncertainty. How many people have the new coronavirus? How many people will become infected and never know? How likely are they to spread it? What role do children play? What is the actual death rate? These are crucial data, and we simply don’t have reliable estimates right now ( ). In addition, how societies behave feeds back into the epidemic’s severity, adding another layer of uncertainty. The way the virus behaves in China or Italy will be different from how it behaves here, depending on what we do. The only thing we know for sure is that things continue to change rapidly, which also means that in these circumstances, anyone claiming certainty is suspect.

Given the limited testing to date, some deaths and probably the vast majority of infections due to SARS-CoV-2 are being missed. We don’t know if we are failing to capture infections by a factor of three or 300. Three months after the outbreak emerged, most countries, including the U.S., lack the ability to test a large number of people and no countries have reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in a representative random sample of the general population.
57.71	1323	[transmission jan wa1 virus wuhan infections infection]	https://bedford.io/blog/ncov-cryptic-transmission/	"The field of genomic epidemiology focuses on using the genetic sequences of pathogens to understand patterns of transmission and spread. Viruses mutate very quickly and accumulate changes during the process of transmission from one infected individual to another. The novel coronavirus which is responsible for the emerging COVID-19 pandemic mutates at an average of about two mutations per month ( ). After someone is exposed they will generally incubate the virus for ~5 days before symptoms develop and transmission occurs. Other research has shown that the ""serial interval"" of SARS-CoV-2 is ~7 days. You can think of a transmission chain as looking something like:"

Most patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections have reportedly had mild to severe respiratory illness with symptoms such as fever, cough and shortness of breath, which might appear 2–14 d after exposure. However, there are other patients who are diagnosed by a positive RT–PCR test but are either asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic 2 ( #ref-CR2 ) , 3 ( #ref-CR3 ) , 4 ( #ref-CR4 ) , 5 ( #ref-CR5 ) , 6 ( ). Increasing evidence has shown that asymptomatic individuals can spread the virus efficiently, and the emergence of these silent spreaders of SARS-CoV-2 has caused difficulties in the control of the epidemic 2 ( ) , 5 ( ). However, our understanding of the clinical features and immune responses of asymptomatic individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection is limited. Here we describe the epidemiological and clinical characteristics, virus levels and immune responses in 37 asymptomatic individuals.
47.00	1158	[cov sars shc014 ma15 urbani cells covs]	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26552008/	The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV underscores the threat of cross-species transmission events leading to outbreaks in humans. Here we examine the disease potential of a SARS-like virus, SHC014-CoV, which is currently circulating in Chinese horseshoe bat populations. Using the SARS-CoV reverse genetics system, we generated and characterized a chimeric virus expressing the spike of bat coronavirus SHC014 in a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV backbone. The results indicate that group 2b viruses encoding the SHC014 spike in a wild-type backbone can efficiently use multiple orthologs of the SARS receptor human angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2), replicate efficiently in primary human airway cells and achieve in vitro titers equivalent to epidemic strains of SARS-CoV. Additionally, in vivo experiments demonstrate replication of the chimeric virus in mouse lung with notable pathogenesis. Evaluation of available SARS-based immune-therapeutic and prophylactic modalities revealed poor efficacy; both monoclonal antibody and vaccine approaches failed to neutralize and protect from infection with CoVs using the novel spike protein. On the basis of these findings, we synthetically re-derived an infectious full-length SHC014 recombinant virus and demonstrate robust viral replication both in vitro and in vivo. Our work suggests a potential risk of SARS-CoV re-emergence from viruses currently circulating in bat populations.

There are still questions about how SARS -CoV-2 initially took hold, such as precisely how and where it jumped from an animal, presumably a bat, to a human, and what other species might have served as intermediaries in the chain of transmission. Chinese officials also gave misleading accounts of the initial outbreak in Wuhan, and these reports served to underplay how common human-to-human transmission was. But those real failures have been exploited by President Trump ( ) , who regularly mentions them as a way to distract from his own failings. The United States is not alone in this regard: anger at China is rising in India ( ) (where the country’s Muslim minority has also been scapegoated for the virus’s spread). But it is fair to say that the center of super-spreaders in what has been an epidemic of attacks on Asian-Americans has been Washington.

Here we present the results of epidemiological modelling which has informed policymaking in the UK and other countries in recent weeks. In the absence of a COVID-19 vaccine, we assess the potential role of a number of public health measures – so-called non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) – aimed at reducing contact rates in the population and thereby reducing transmission of the virus. In the results presented here, we apply a previously published microsimulation model to two countries: the UK (Great Britain specifically) and the US. We conclude that the effectiveness of any one intervention in isolation is likely to be limited, requiring multiple interventions to be combined to have a substantial impact on transmission.

It depends on how likely someone is to be infected after contact with an infectious person, and how often such contact occurs—and these quantities are also affected by how societies deal with a virus. When SARS first emerged, transmission dynamics played out very differently in China and Canada, which is why the virus’s R0 values cover a wide range, from 2 to 5. “In places with good infection control, where you can isolate cases as soon as they happen, you’ll see a lower R0 than, say, in places where an outbreak initially took off,” Majumder says.

Increased news coverage and awareness of the virus in the general population have likely already prompted increased rates of seeking medical care for respiratory symptoms. In addition, awareness among health care providers and public health officials and the availability of viral identification assays suggest that capacity for identifying previously missed infections has increased. Further, general population and government response efforts have increased the use of face masks, restricted travel, delayed school reopening, and isolated suspected persons, all of which could additionally slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

After all, the new virus is transmitting readily in countries like Singapore (which is in the tropics) and Australia (which is still in summer). And one recent modeling study ( ) concluded that “SARS-CoV-2 can proliferate at any time of year.” “I don’t have an immense amount of confidence that the weather is going to have the effect that people hope it will,” Gralinski says. “It may knock things down a little, but there’s so much person-to-person transmission going on that it may take more than that.” Unless people can slow the spread of the virus by sticking to physical-distancing recommendations, the summer alone won’t save us.

A new study ( ) shows that people who are infected with milder human coronaviruses release fewer viral particles when they wear surgical masks. “I’ve been slightly dismissive of masks, but I was looking at them in the wrong way,” Harvard’s Bill Hanage told me. “You’re not wearing them to stop yourself getting infected, but to stop someone else getting infected.” This might be especially important for SARS-CoV-2, which can spread without immediately causing symptoms. If people are infectious before they fall sick, then everyone should wear face masks “when going out in public, in one additional societal effort to slow the spread of the virus down,” says Thomas Inglesby of the John Hopkins Center for Health Security.

As of January 23, there are over *800 cases ( )* of 2019-nCoV confirmed globally, including cases in at least 20 regions in China and nine The first reported infected individuals, some of whom showed symptoms as early as *December 8* ( ) , were discovered to be among stallholders from the Wuhan South China Seafood Market. Subsequently, the wet market was closed on Jan 1. The virus causing the outbreak was quickly determined to be a *novel coronavirus ( )*. On January 10, gene sequencing further determined it to be the new Wuhan coronavirus, namely *2019-nCoV ( )* , a betacoronavirus, related to the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome virus (MERS-CoV) and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome virus (SARSCoV). However, the mortality and transmissibility of 2019-nCoV are still unknown, and likely to vary from those of the prior referenced coronaviruses.

While there is no good evidence to support asymptomatic transmission, we know that infectious viruses can be found without symptoms, for other viruses. It probably isn’t a major transmission route, though. So, unless we’re seeing something very different with this new coronavirus, people with coughs and sneezes and runny noses are more likely to be the major avenue for spread. If we do have milder disease due to the coronavirus – I expect we do – that will definitely make it harder to contain.

Today, nurses, physicians, and first responders exposed to known cases of COVID-19, some of whom have developed disease, are being quarantined, which threatens to collapse the health care system. It is anticipated that convalescent serum will prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in those to whom it is administered. If this is established, individuals who receive convalescent sera may be able to avoid a period of quarantine. This could allow them to continue their critical function as health care providers. Convalescent sera could also be used to prevent disease among family members caring for COVID-19 patients at home. Clearly, the use of convalescent serum would be a stopgap measure that could be used in the midst of the current epidemic. However, even local deployment will entail considerable coordination between different entities, such as infectious disease specialists, hematologists, blood banking specialists, and hospital administrators. Hence, as we are in the midst of a worldwide pandemic, we recommend that institutions consider the emergency use of convalescent sera and begin preparations as soon as possible. Time is of the essence.

Since this outbreak was first reported in late-2019, the virus has infected over 75,000 people and has caused over 2,100 reported deaths (as of 21 st February 2020). It has been declared a Public Health Emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO).  Currently there is no vaccine available for COVID-19.

Can transmission take place before the onset of symptoms? (Measles, one of the most contagious diseases on Earth, is infectious two to four days beforehand.) Do people who never become symptomatic nonetheless spread the disease? Do symptomatic people become less contagious over time, like SARS, or is it like Ebola, which becomes increasingly contagious as the disease progresses? These are all unanswered questions.

SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibody levels may remain over the course of seven weeks [15] or at least in 80% of the cases until day 49 [16]. In comparison, 90% and 50% of SARS-CoV-1 infected patients have been shown to maintain IgG antibodies for two and three years respectively [17]. In addition, it could be important to detect nasal IgA antibodies, as the serum IgA antibodies were not raised, but IgA persisted in the nasal mucosa one year post-infection for seasonal coronavirus 229E [18].

But looking at it from the other side, various surveys ( ) indicate that among folks experiencing anosmia, viruses are thought to be responsible for about a quarter of cases.

It has a phylogenetic similarity to SARS-CoV and it was named coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and caused severe acute respiratory syndrome that could lead to death. One of the promising therapeutic strategies for virus infection is the search for enzyme inhibitors among natural compounds using molecular docking in order to obtain products with minimal side effects. COVID-19 virus main protease plays a vital role in mediating viral transcription and replication, introducing it as an attractive antiviral agent target. Metabolic profiling of the aqueous extract of Salvadora persica L. (Salvadoraceae) aerial parts dereplicated eleven known flavonol glycosides using LC-HRESIMS. All the annotated flavonoids exhibited significant binding stability at the N3 binding site to different degrees, except isorhamnetin-3- O -β- D -glucopyranoside, when compared with the currently used COVID-19 main protease inhibitor, darunavir. Structural similarity between the identified flavonoids enabled the study of the relationship between their structure and interactions with the receptor in the N3 binding site of the COVID-19 main protease. The results indicate that the basic flavonol nucleus possesses activity itself. Moreover, the presence of a rutinose moiety at the 3 position of ring C and absence of an O -methyl group in ring B of the flavonol structure could increase the binding stability. This study provides a scientific basis for the health benefits of the regular use of S. persica as it leaches bioactive flavonoids in the aqueous saliva.

These are not meant to be N95 masks, and they are not meant to protect the wearer. They are meant to limit the transmission of COVID-19 from the wearer who may be asymptomatic.

Time between symptom onset, NAAT testing, and sample collection is not known for all samples. Both SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies are present in all positive samples used. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) detected the presence of IgG and IgM antibodies at their laboratory using their SARS-CoV-2 spike enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests. (See Serology Testing for COVID-19 ( ) , which notes “CDC’s serologic test is designed and validated for broad-based surveillance and research that will give us information needed to guide the response to the pandemic and protect the public’s health. The test is not currently designed to test individuals who want to know if they have been previously infected with COVID-19.”) The presence of antibodies was confirmed at FNLCR using CDC’s developed ELISAs (Pan-Ig, IgG, and IgM) as well as an IgG Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) ELISA developed by the Krammer Laboratory at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. (An implementation of this test, the COVID-19 ELISA IgG Antibody Test, has been granted an EUA authorization by FDA for use at the Mount Sinai Laboratory (MSL), Center for Clinical Laboratories, a division of the Department of Pathology, Molecular, and Cell-Based Medicine, New York, NY. See this EUA Summary ( ).) The positive samples selected may not reflect the distribution of antibody levels in patient populations that would be evaluated by such a test. Because all samples are positive for both IgM and IgG, this evaluation cannot verify that tests intended to detect IgM and IgG antibodies separately detect these antibodies independently.

48.02	1404	[flu coronavirus crisis warzel property covid deaths]	https://www.hoover.org/research/playing-politics-coronavirus	Why has there been such a dramatic mismatch in the responses to ordinary flu and the coronavirus? Medical and epidemiological experts say that the capacity of COVID-19 to spread could generate huge numbers of deaths and illnesses worldwide. It is presently estimated that COVID-19 has a global mortality rate in the ballpark ( ) of 3 percent, being roughly an order of magnitude more fatal than traditional influenza ( ). COVID-19 may also be more contagious ( ) than the flu: Preliminary studies suggest that one infected with the coronavirus will infect somewhere between 2 and 3 others, whereas one infected with the flu will spread it, on average, only to 1.3 others.  Even still, we are a long way from the Spanish flu pandemic ( ) of 1918, which resulted in perhaps 500 million infections and between 50 and 100 million deaths worldwide, including some 675,000 Americans. The level of medical and institutional sophistication today makes it exceedingly unlikely that these results will be replicated with COVID-19.

For example, they could recommend trusted, accessible locations for new testing sites and advise on how to diversify the pool of contact tracers ( ) , who will be crucial to tamping down the spread of infection in reopened communities. They could also collaborate with government leaders to ensure that all people who are infected with coronavirus (or exposed to someone infected) have a safe, secure, and acceptable place to isolate or quarantine for 14 days. Key partners could include community health centers, small business associations, community organizing groups, and workers’ rights organizations, among others. Ultimately, state and local leaders should measure the success of their response based not only on total death counts and aggregate economic impacts but also on the health and social outcomes of the most marginalized.

CDC guidance for the care of patients with COVID-19 therefore recommends that N95 respirators be worn by staff present during these procedures. But the lack of evidence that the virus aerosolizes in any other situation is one reason why the CDC tells us that surgical (“droplet”) masks can be worn during the routine care of people with COVID-19 infection.

Scientists have been working at lightning speed to elucidate as much as they can about this novel virus. It is now known that SARS-CoV-2 entry, like that of SARS-CoV and MERS CoV, depends on binding of the viral spike (S) protein to cellular receptors. The cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV is hACE2, an angiotensin receptor. Another key step is the priming of the S protein by host cell proteases. The S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is primed by the serine protease TMPRSS2.

As of June 18, 2020, over 8.4 million cases and 450,000 deaths resulting from infection by a novel SARS coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (also termed Coronavirus Disease 2019 or COVID-19), have now been confirmed worldwide; furthermore, there have been more than 2.2 million confirmed cases and over 110,000 deaths due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA alone [ 2 ( ) ]. Unlike other CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 has had much larger global spread and has impacted more people than SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV combined [ 1 ( ) ]. Morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19 rise dramatically with age and co-existing health conditions, including cancer and cardiovascular diseases, and while most infected individuals recover, even very young and otherwise healthy patients may unpredictably succumb to this disease [ 3 ( ) ]. These observations beg the question of how much of the variation in COVID-19 disease severity may be explained by genetic susceptibility. Human genetic factors may contribute to the extremely high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 and to the relentlessly progressive disease observed in a small but significant proportion of infected individuals; yet, these factors are largely unknown. Development of new preventive therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 will be greatly facilitated by systematic identification of host genetic pathways and DNA polymorphisms (variants) which modulate the risk of infection and severe illness, including the overexuberant immune response to the virus that often portends a poor outcome.

With each infected person expected to infect 2 or 3 additional people, 2 as well as remaining uncertainty regarding the clinical spectrum of disease, 3 COVID-19 threatens to overwhelm the US healthcare system within the coming months. Even currently, before COVID-19 infection rates reach high-risk levels in the United States, patients with mild respiratory symptoms are seeking COVID-19 confirmatory testing and clinical reassurance from providers, and employers are developing response plans that may include requiring sick employees to seek healthcare provider release before returning to work. Because of this mounting public urgency and currently uncontained spread, healthcare providers are already experiencing and must prepare for additional increased volumes of both sick and worried-well patients that could strain hospital care units and medical equipment supply chains. Healthcare provider disaster response policies and procedures should be revisited to incorporate telemedicine systems to address some of the unique challenges posed by infectious disease outbreaks such as COVID-19.

Infection is an unavoidable clinical problem in the elderly patient taking antihypertensive medications. Pneumonia and influenza could be fatal in the elderly patients with cardiovascular complications, which are the result of long-term hypertension and other risk factors. In fact, vaccination against pneumonia and influenza is highly recommended in elderly with or without cardiovascular complications. Recent pandemic outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), so called, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are posing a similar challenge in which the majority of fatalities are being observed in the elderly with hypertension, diabetes their complications.

46.07	3693	[ncov neonates infection symptoms chest delivery showed]	http://tp.amegroups.com/article/view/35919/28274	In December 2019, a novel coronavirus labelled 2019-nCoV, which is believed to have originated in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei province, began spreading rapidly across China. The virus is transmitted mainly via respiratory droplets contact, and human-to-human transmission and family clustering have been reported ( 1 ( #B1 ) , 2 ( #B2 ) ). As of 7:00 AM on February 5, 2020, according to data released by the National Health Commission of China, 23,696 cases of the virus were confirmed in China, and other countries, including Japan, Thailand, Singapore, Republic of Korea, the United States, and Australia have also reported cases. Human populations are generally susceptible to 2019-nCoV, and it bears a particularly high risk for pregnant women and children because they are in a special state of immune suppression. In fact, the youngest patient confirmed with 2019-nCoV infection was only 1 month old. As the biological characteristics of 2019-nCoV require further investigation, it is unclear whether mother-to-infant transmission is possible, and thus there is no sufficient evidence for the prevention and control of neonatal infections. In this article, we retrospectively analyzed the clinical features and outcomes of 10 neonates (including 2 twins) born to 9 mothers with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection in 5 hospitals in Hubei from January 20 to February 5, 2020, in an attempt to inform the management of neonates born during the 2019-nCoV outbreak.

Interstitial pneumonia and ILD are manifestations of some viral infections in a subgroup of patients in the short term and may persist for months or years in another subgroup of patients who survive following severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) associated with coronavirus,” said Ganesh Raghu, MD, professor of medicine and adjunct professor of laboratory medicine at the University of Washington (UW) and director of the Center for Interstitial Lung Disease at UW Medicine. “Certain pathobiological features of COVID-19 are similar to features of interstitial pneumonia and acute exacerbations of fibrotic lung diseases. Therapeutic strategies targeting pathways of immune dysregulation, innate immunity, inflammation and fibrosis are appropriate to consider as potential treatments of COVID-19 and fibrotic ILD in the context of clinical trials.”

The health of these patients often rapidly deteriorates due to the unchecked immune response to the virus leading to hyperinflammation and cytokine storm,” said Jeffrey Cleland, Ph.D., Chairman, CEO & President at Ashvattha Therapeutics and Executive Chairman of Orpheris. “The hydroxyl dendrimer component of OP-101 enables targeting to reactive macrophages, which are responsible for hyperinflammation, lung injury, and multi-organ failure caused by COVID-19. OP-101 normalizes reactive macrophages, shuts down the cytokine cascade and reduces oxidative stress to arrest hyperinflammation.

The expansion phase coincided with the Lunar New Year holiday period during which schools were closed, and schools remained closed thereafter. Additionally, cases in children were likely missed, as those with mild – or absent – symptoms were unlikely to receive testing.

Speaking to Science ( ) , Georgetown University infectious disease specialist Daniel Lucey noted that since the virus seems to have an incubation period of up to 14 days ( ) and the first reported case emerged on Dec 1, it’s possible the initial human infection took place in November. And since the virus presents only cold-like symptoms in many individuals, Patient Zero—whoever they are—could have spread it to others long before health officials knew what to look for. That means it could have infected humans before even making it to the market under scrutiny.

The failure to understand the difference between coronavirus strains has led to a proliferation of conspiracy theories, including one in which a patent on a coronavirus strain for a vaccine (as I understand it) has led to arguments that this outbreak was caused by a bioweapon. Such conspiracy theories -as I discuss at length on this blog and in my work- ( ) appear with every epidemic. Misleading articles have claimed that the actually vastly higher ( ) than has been publicly reported. Although Bill Gates is often a prominent figure in these conspiracy theories, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has given $10 million dollars to help fight the virus. Overall, the science is moving forward quickly, and false reports on social media are being challenged.

The role of Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, China, in spreading 2019-nCoV remains murky, though such sequencing, combined with sampling the market’s environment for the presence of the virus, is clarifying that it indeed had an important early role in amplifying the outbreak. The viral sequences, most researchers say, also knock down the idea the pathogen came from a virology institute in Wuhan.

53.34	1549	[patients cov sars covid infection cardiovascular symptoms]	https://www.nature.com/articles/s41569-020-0360-5	In December 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus occurred in Wuhan, Hubei province, and has spread rapidly throughout China, with an ongoing risk of a pandemic 1 ( ). After virus identification and isolation, the pathogen for this pneumonia was originally called 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) 2 ( ) but has subsequently been officially named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the WHO. On 30 January 2020, the WHO declared the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Compared with the SARS-CoV that caused an outbreak of SARS in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 has a stronger transmission capacity. The rapid increase in confirmed cases makes the prevention and control of COVID-19 extremely serious. Although the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are dominated by respiratory symptoms, some patients have severe cardiovascular damage 3 ( ). In addition, some patients with underlying cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) might have an increased risk of death 3 ( ). Therefore, understanding the damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 to the cardiovascular system and the underlying mechanisms is of the greatest importance, so that treatment of these patients can be timely and effective and mortality reduced.

The policy rewarded couples for having a single child with better houses, free education and healthcare, and cash bonuses. The birth rate dropped from 2.1 to about 1.4 children per woman. The policy was met with resistance especially in the rural areas as women avoided giving birth in hospitals and families lied in population censuses resulting in skewed data. The government ended the policy in 2016 after experts warned that the country was at risk of losing a generation to replace the aging population.

In addition, the new law gives states the option to provide Medicaid coverage of COVID-19 testing for uninsured residents with 100% federal financing.
