This is concordant with recent clinical observations which show that COVID-19 exhibits a reduced interferon response in comparison to other respiratory viruses such as influenza and SARS.

Studies now consistently ( ) indicate that infectivity starts before symptoms do ( ) , that it peaks right around the day that they start, and that it declines substantially by five days or so. This is the pattern we see in influenza. But it’s the opposite of the pattern we saw with the coronavirus that caused China’s SARS outbreak eighteen years ago. That virus had a low risk of transmission until after five days from the onset of symptoms, which made it easier to identify and isolate cases before others got infected. No large-scale lockdown was necessary. It seems that there are also plenty of people who are infected by the virus that causes COVID -19 who never become symptomatic, especially children. So far, studies of transmission networks have not revealed such silent carriers to be a major source of spread. Nonetheless, patients who do not yet show symptoms, or have just begun to, are turning out to be important vectors of disease.

63.52	1092	[spread pandemic health disease masks virus know]	https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/nine-important-things-weve-learned-about-the-coronavirus-pandemic-so-far/	*Misinformation kills.* The president of the United States, other politicians, anti-vaccine activists ( ) , and members of the right-wing media, to their everlasting shame, have used the pandemic to stoke racism, spread misinformation and amplify conspiracy theories. Their followers have threatened health officials, including Tony Fauci and his family ( ) ; refused to wear masks; refused to cooperate with contact tracers ( ) ; and rejected proven basic public health advice about social distancing. Representative Louie Gohmert, who refused to wear a mask in the Capitol and reportedly discouraged his staff and interns ( ) from wearing masks, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 ( ) and is being treated with hydroxychloroquine ( ) , a drug that Trump has endorsed but that has failed in clinical trials ( ). Trump supporter Herman Cain died of COVID-19 ( ) on July 30, weeks after attending a rally in Tulsa without a mask. Calls to poison-control centers spiked ( ) after Trump speculated that injecting or ingesting disinfectants could protect against the coronavirus. Early evidence suggests people who watched Fox News were more likely to downplay the pandemic ( ) , worsening the spread ( ). The most important public health measure during a pandemic of a disease with no cure or vaccine—as many countries around the world that have controlled the virus have shown—is to help experts share clear, trustworthy, accurate, actionable information ( ) based on the best evidence. Spreading lies has spread this disease.

The health, social, and economic impact of this disease is unprecedented in our life-time. The COVID-19 pandemic has collapsed health care systems and led to an overwhelming pressure on Intensive Care Units (ICUs), since many patients developed profound hypoxemia and extensive pulmonary infiltrates requiring intubation and ventilatory support [ 2 ( ) ].

FluMist, for example, contains weakened flu viruses, and a handful of research groups ( ) are looking into the strategy for COVID-19. But live virus vaccines are riskier because, well, the virus is live. “We don’t want to be spraying coronavirus up people’s noses until [we] are absolutely sure that it’s actually a virus that can’t spread from person to person and that it can’t make somebody sick,” says Kathleen Neuzil ( ) , the director of the University of Maryland’s Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health. “It will just take time.”

Nevertheless, given the potential of vaccines to end or contain the most deadly pandemic in a century, world leaders as varied as French President Emmanuel Macron, Chinese President Xi Jinping, and UN Secretary-General António Guterres have referred ( ) to them as global public goods—a resource to be made available to all, with the use of a vaccine in one country not interfering with its use in another.

For example, during the response to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 ( ) , the country prioritized population health over concerns for the economic impact of its response. Officials deployed a multi-sector response incorporating military, public security services and grassroot organizations while ensuring that transparent risk communication and effective community mobilization were emphasized throughout the outbreak. These lessons were certainly pulled into its current strategy. The country has also faced other outbreaks ( ) from which it drew similar lessons including Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, avian influenza, measles and dengue. Partners such as Gavi and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( ) have also invested in the country’s health system capacities long-term.

That happens when virus particles contained in smaller droplets don’t settle out within six feet and instead hang in the air and drift on currents.

This novel corona virus SARS-CoV-2 has a specific tropism for the low respiratory airways, but causes severe pneumonia in a low percentage of patients. However, the rapid spread of the infection during this pandemic is causing the need to hospitalize a high number of patients. Pneumonia in COVID-19 has peculiar features and can be studied by lung ultrasound in the early approach to suspected patients. The sonographic signs are non-specific when considered alone, but observation of some aspects of vertical artifacts can enhance the diagnostic power of the ultrasound examination. Also, the combination of sonographic signs in patterns and their correlation with blood exams in different phenotypes of the disease may allow for a reliable characterization and be of help in triaging and admitting patients.

Nasal respiratory epithelial cells and olfactory epithelial support cells have been shown to express high levels of ACE2 proteins used by the SARS-Cov2 virus, which causes the COVID-19 syndrome, to infect cells [ 2 ( ) ]. Previously described human strains of coronavirus have also been demonstrated to invade the central nervous system and propagate from within the olfactory bulb [ 3 ( ) ]. It is therefore perhaps no surprise that alterations in sense of smell would be reported by patients with COVID-19.
